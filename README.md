# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling framework for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences with the potential for unknown outcomes; it is:

- additive,
- rules-light, and
- action-oriented.

## Versioning

While in beta, each chapter is given a version number along with the content in total. It might feel a little confusing.

We use a standard [major/0].[minor/beta].[patch] pattern.

- 0.*n*.*n*: Content is considered beta and changes may include "breaking changes," which means previous implementations in whole or in part will not be compatible.
- 1.*n*.*n*: Content is considered out of beta. 
- Patch releases: Are usually performed to correct grammar and increase clarity without modifying implementations.
- Minor releases: May encompass patch releases and are usually performed when new implementations are added and would not affect implementations in previous versions.
- Major releases: May encompass minor releases and are usually performed when implementations are changed in such a way that characters or implementations from previous releases would need to be altered in some way.
