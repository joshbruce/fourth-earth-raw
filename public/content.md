# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling framework for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences with the potential for unknown outcomes; it is:

- additive,
- rules-light, and
- action-oriented.

Being additive allows you to build into stories by adding pieces not explicitly spelled out without starting from scratch; compared to systems providing creatures, settings, worlds, and mechanics. Rules-light means it's more informational with a minimal mechanic allowing you to implement a that feels right for you and the other playesrs. Becing action-oriented refers to the primary mechanic affording you a generic way to interact with the world; complexity is optional.

The overall system is applicable to:

- solo adventures (one player of one or more characters, with or without a separate narrator), 
- tabletop (more than one player, with or without a separate narrator, possibly with the aid of a computer), and 
- computer-aided where the computer acts as the narrator and makes computation easier.

Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting, theme, and campaign.

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Narrators
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role play over Grinding to become a demigod or metagaming
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge
7. Power ceilings over threat escalation

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and hold their own or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: there are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation and there is no history of the setting built in.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players may choose death or continuing with the same character, at a cost.

## Creating the setting

Settings hold various characters tailored to a given theme; a high-level central tension may also exist. The setting, theme, and storyline may be create by a narrator, by the players, or any combination establishing one or more of the following:

1. Where does the story take place (jungle, city, desert, ship)?
2. What level of technology exists (advanced non-combat technology and archaic tools made with advanced materials)?
3. What governing structures exist?

It should be enough to give flavor to the world, not necessarily an in-depth description of all aspects. For example:

1. A one-shot story in a mundane world filled with ordinary people (a situational comedy or drama).
2. A serial in the spiritual plain filled with deities and demons (mythology).
3. Or even a mundane world filled with ordinary people and the occassional deity or demon (super heroics).

In the examples above, the description following "filled with" establishes the theme's foundation; again, just enough to establish common ground and initial expectations.

## Populating the setting

All living beings abide by the same rules and mechanics for action and life consisting of at least:

1. name, allowing for easy identification and differentiation;
2. type, lending a categorization mechanism; and
3. the health battery, which differentiates the being as being alive, subdued, or dead.

Cally the earthworm, for example.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

Living things die, it's the trade-off of life. The health battery simulates the reality that most living things fade over time not in one hit, so to speak. If the health battery reaches and reamins at 0, the living thing is dead.

The first question to ask yourself is: Is your game a permadeath or not?

Permadeath means death is considered a permanent state and there is no way to recover. If you want to keep playing, a new character is needed. This can feel realistic and at the same time can be very frustrating as games do not accurately simulate life; a character may die from the random roll of dice. Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated on a resolution to this question; just offers some thoughts to cover various scenarios.

Generally, regardless of setting or theme, there should be a way for the health battery to lose and recharge points. If using time passed, characters may starve to death or gradually reclaim points. If using items or magic, characters may take damage from outside forces or reclaim points in chunks.

Resurrection may follow the health battery being at 0 for a short amount of time during which an external force causes the battery to return to 1 or more. In a mundane setting, this may simulate CPR or defibrilator paddles. In a fatasy adventure, it may be magic or healing potions. The guideline is the character should experience some form of loss (simulating something like physical therapy or lack of oxygen), but is able to awaken in the same place they died. As a game mechanic, resurrection attempts to instill caution in players; death may not be permanent but there will be a setback if it happens.

Reincarnation is similar to resurrection only the loss may be a bit more. Characters may lose all physical possessions, be awakened in an area different than the one in which they died, and not have the same level of proficiency they once had as they learn to navigate a slightly less broken in body.

Consider the following example:

|Type of recovery |Life batteries |Skills |Tool poficiency |Physical goods |
|:----------------|:--------------|:------|:---------------|:--------------|
|Resurrection     |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 1 point |All ranks reduced by 1 point |Still around or recoverable |
|Reincarnation    |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 2 points |All ranks reduced by 2 points |No longer available |

More on proficiency points as they relate to ranks in the "Skill and tools" section.

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

The opposing force has qualities which are used to determine the difficulty of success, which is then attempted by the character through decisions made by the player. (See "Difficulty" section.)

For an action to be considered resolved, the following questions must be answered:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider the following, separate actions: climbing a tree and attacking a rat, respectively.

The initial physical difficulty of the tree climb is 6. The player reduces the difficulty to 4. That reduction came from spending one point from the physical battery; if the player had spent two more points, the difficulty would be "Done!" - immediate success. The player decided to only spend one point; therefore, a dice pool of one or more dice is rolled. (See "Dice pool" section.)

Another way to change the probability for success, is through ranks in skills and tools (see "Skills and tools" section). This character has one rank in climbing, which means the player will roll two dice. To succeed, at least one of the dice in the pool need to land on a 1.

If the character succeeds in the climbing the tree, they end up in the tree; if they fail, they stay on the ground. In either case, the action is resolved.

Let's switch to the rat, which has a difficulty of 6; everything is the same as the tree climb. If the character succeeds, the rat is hit; if they fail, the rat is missed.

To remain simple, rules-light, and minimize context switching, Fourth Earth RAW strives to use this same mechanism for all interactions characters have with the outside world. Details may change, but the flow remains: intent, difficulty, adjust, roll, if necessary.

### Difficulty

Difficulty describes the initial probability of success for a given interaction with the world. Difficulty starts with the sides of dice available in a standard set of roleplaying game dice set: four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided; with a solution for (or actual) two-sided die (recommended to use a [.d4](four-sided die) and accept a roll of an odd number). This gives us four primary ways to refer to a given difficulty:

1. sides of dice in a pool,
2. level,
3. probability, and
4. human-friendly.

When communicating difficulty to a player, it's recommended, that the sides of dice are used: "Roll d4." When modifying difficulty, it's recommended, that level is used where the level is typically the sides of the die divided by 2 ([.d20](twenty-sided die) is the exception): "You reduce the d20 by 1 level, making it a d12 (level 6)." Probability is 1 in the number of sides on the die; also represented as 1/10 or 10 percent. The human-friendly names (or derivations of them) are rarely used in game; usually as reference.

|Sides       |Level |Success probability |Human-friendly   |
|:----------:|:----:|:------------------:|:----------------|
| 1          | 0    |1/1                 |Done!            |
| 2          | 1    |1/2                 |Safe bet         |
| 4          | 2    |1/4                 |Simple           |
| 6          | 3    |1/6                 |Difficult        |
| 8          | 4    |1/8                 |Long shot        |
| 10         | 5    |1/10                |Leap of faith    |
| 12         | 6    |1/12                |Improbable       |
| 20         | 7    |1/20                |Inconceivable    |
| n/a        | 8    |n/a                 |Impossible, if not lowered |
| n/a        |infinity |0                |Impossible       |

Note: For the purposes of these guides, referencing "difficulty" refers to "Sides" while any other usage will be modified with appropriately; "difficulty level," for example.

Two-sided dice may be difficult to find. A coin can be used but may be easier to game. Alternatively, players may use any other die so long as odd numbers are considered 1 and even numbers 2 (beyond coins, this may be the arrangement for physical, two-sided dice).

When determining difficulty, the recommendation is to consider an average person in the setting and theme (how likely would they be succeed?). Depending on the setting and theme and to keep characters challenged, a more relative scale might be useful. 

For example, character A is not particularly trained in any first aid and decides to attempt stitching a wound in a finger, a physical difficulty of 8 or higher might be realistic. Alternatively, character B is trained in veterinary medicine and might receive a physical difficulty of 4 or 6. Or, in a mundane world, unassisted flight would be infinity, then character A gains the ability to fly, the first attempt might be a difficulty 8 and becoming 0 over time.

Success is determined by rolling at least one 1 from the dice pool. (See "Dice pool" section.)

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall health and vitality.

The maximum value of any life battery is 8.

The only life battery required by Fourth Earth RAW is the health battery. If the battery is reduced to and remains at 0, the character is dead.

Your game may have any number of batteries, with the following considerations:

1. The higher the number of batteries, the harder they are to manage and the tension in the action economy becomes reduced.
2. Use overflow batteries where points from one or more other batteries can be converted to a single point in another battery; cost should be greater than reward, at least 2 points per 1 generated.
3. The health battery should not be available as an overflow.

Consider a system where the cost is the total number of overflow batteries; physical has 2 overflows and health has 3. 

Let's spend 1 point from the physical battery to reduce the difficulty of climbing the tree; notice the character has 0 physical points available to start: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce difficulty) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

To raise the physical battery 1 point means converting 2 battery points pulled on a rotating basis from the other batteries. The target cost is more important than where the points came from; however, distributing the cost evenly is more important than player choice in this instance.

Now consider taking a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1 (maybe the rat hit the character):

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the physical, mental, and spirit batteries (being exhausted is acceptable, being dead typically isn't). It costs 3 battery points to generate 1 point for the health battery.

Life batteries should recharge somehow; usually multiple ways. At least one of these recharging actions should be something the characters can initiate. For example, a "mundane game" (as opposed to an "action-adventure" game), might see a character fall from a ladder and have their health battery drained by 3. Maybe they go to sleep. Maybe they take some medicine. Maybe they go to the hospital. Maybe they do some combination. These are all actions the character can take to recover from the drain on their batteries.

### Dice pools

Dice pools adjust probability of success for a given action based on skill proficiency, tools used, and other similar modifiers.

Consider a difficulty 2, which is a 1/2 probability of success, using a dice pool of 2, which makes the probability 3/4. Or, consider a difficulty 20, which is a 1/20, 2 dice in the pool, becomes (just under) a 1/10.

Adding dice in Fourth Earth RAW is done through ranks in skills, tools, or both. You may decide to other ways for dice to be added to (or subtracted from) the pools. (See "Skill and tools" section.)

There is always one die in the pool; it's recommended dice pools not surpass 5. 

More than 5 and the pool becomes physically harder to manage and tends to cross the point of diminishing returns.

Using percentages should make this easier to illustrate. A difficulty 2 has a 50 percent chance of success. With 5 dice in the pool, that becomes roughly 97 percent. To get to a 99.9 percent chance of success requires another 5 dice. First 5 is a 47 percent gain while 10 is a 49.9 percent gain from the starting point.

For cases where a larger pool might feel like the "right" answer, consider adjusting the difficulty. Consider a difficulty 20 with 5 dice in the pool, which is roughly a 23 percent chance of success. If the pool had 10 dice, it would be a 40 percent chance, which is roughly a difficulty 5 with 5 dice in the pool; the margin of difference is less than 1 percent.

It is recommended players (and narrators) determine the maximum dice pool size up front, then:

1. subtract one for the base pool and
2. split the remainder between skill ranks, tool ranks, and any other ways the dice pool might increase.

## Movement

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated when it comes to movement beyond creating a desirable experience for those involved. In the type of games most likely to use Fourth Earth RAW, there's a spectrum for space-time and a desire to compress the mundane.

One end of this spectrum is real time simulation; a minute in-game is a minute in-real-life, a mile in-game is a mile in-real-life. We might see the other end as battle simulation and tends to feel more like playing chess; players may take hours to move and may have conversations their characters couldn't in the heat of battle (arguably could be referred to as "metagaming"). 

In the former, the player *is* the character and in the latter the player is more of a storyteller and puppetmaster. The former may be represented as live-action-role-playing and the latter might be represented as a turn-based tabletop roleplaying game with miniatures (or chess).

Fourth Earth RAW slants more toward real time simulation while using dice roll resolution to allow for theater of the mind instead of live-action or miniatures:

1. Make a declaration of what characters are doing.
2. Roll the dice pools.
3. Resolve the outcome.

This means time will tend to scale based on what is happening to compress the mundane. Long, mundane travel over great distances are compressed to be as short as possible real time. Surgical, marvelous actions are inverted. In either case, it can be a good idea to let players know how much in-game time has passed.

For example, a group of characters decide to walk to a location roughly 500 kilometers (~300 miles) away. The average human walks 5 kilometers per hour (~3 miles per hour) and can walk roughly 10 hours per day; therefore, it will take them roughly 10 days to get there. 

As the narrator (or player), unless otherwise agreed to, you might say, "Okay. That's going to take 10 days. How often will you make camp? Does anyone want to act anything out during the trip?" and so on. The narrator may decide to roll some standard die a few times to see if there are any hazards experienced by the characters; shoes fall apart, a bear wanders into camp, someone dies of dysentery, or maybe even something positive. In real time this could take less than one minute but when they arrive, it's still: 10 days later...

Game-time and real time will most likely invert when the characters go inside wherever it is they've arrived to. Details about the setting are given, explored, considered, discussed. It may take hours of real time to do 30 minutes of game-time activities. Let the narrative and intent of the characters drive difficulty. 

A player says their character is going to run the 500 kilometers back to a town and bring help?

This would most likely be an infinite difficulty; unless there is something in the setting and theme that would alter this. For example, let's say the character is super fast, maybe the action (in total) is 4 sub-actions each with a difficulty of "No dice!" Or, maybe being very fast is just innate to the setting and theme, the difficulty might be applied to convincing help to travel to the location the character needs them to.

Another character in a different setting and theme decides to move behind a target and subdue an oppoenent using a blackjack. Might be a difficulty 10 for the movement and a difficulty "No dice!" to subdue the target in one blow; a hit by itself might have been a difficulty 4.

## Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW has no predefined list of skills or tools, which allows players to build skill lists as they play.

The presumption is any character can attempt anything, once. When a character attempts something, a skill can be added to their list, and they may gain proficiency points and ranks in that skill. We find this beats having a limited number of skill available from which to choose.

The maximum dice in a dice pool is bound by the maximum number of ranks in total for skills, tools, and any other contributing factors. (See "Dice pool" section.)

Proficiency points are earned by successfully completing actions with an initial difficulty position greater than the current rank achieved. Proficiency points are added to the lowest unattained rank. Because proficiency points are based on the initial difficulty, reducing the difficulty to 0 could still result in earning proficiency points. The number of proficiency points per rank should be greater than one and consistent across ranks.

Note: Lower-level ranks will tend to be earned quickly while higher-level ranks will take longer. Partly due to filling up the lower-level ranks first and partly because of the possible rarity of higher-level difficulties encountered by characters.

Consider a difficulty of 0; no proficiency points earned. Consider a difficulty 2 and a character with no ranks whose player reduces the difficulty to "Done!"; one proficiency point is earned toward the first rank, which completes the first rank. Consider a difficulty 2 and the same character rolling 2 dice now; no proficiency point is earned. Consider a difficulty 6 (position 3) and the same character rolling 2 dice whose player reduces the difficulty to 2; one proficiency point is earned toward the second (not third) rank.

Tools may also have ranks, which can be earned simultaneously to the skill. This separation simulates the difference between general knowledge in a skill and specific knowledge in a tool.

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the Earth, the grave digger should be afforded a slight advantage when braining a zombie with a shovel; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their proficiency in using a blunt weapon increases. The digger may also take a hit to their probabilities if they switch from the shovel to a baseball bat or even more if switching to a gun.

Tools may also decrease the difficulty of an action. A character can widdle wood with their fingernails but it would probably be easier with a knife.

## Interacting with other living beings

For non-combat actions, the players can negotiate with the narrator to determine the difficulty of the action on another living being.

"I want to persuade this person to do this thing." The narrator might say, "That person didn't require persuasion (difficulty 0), they do it." Or, the narrator might say, "This person has special training against manipulation, roll mental difficulty (or 'd') 10" (presuming a mental battery). Then the player reduces and rolls as usual.

This way game mechanics can be generated just-in-time instead of constraining players and narrators to a finite list of specific interaction types.

For combat actions two additional action steps are recommended to maintain consistency and transparency:

1. Calculating the difficulty in hitting the defender.
2. Calculating the number of points drained from the defender's health battery.

Combat action targets the health battery directly. Difficulty determines how hard the target is to hit; therefore, it's recommended the qualities used help the defender *avoid* being hit or make it *easier* for the attacker to hit. It's also recommended these qualities avoid increasing complexity.

Consider character A (attacker) attacking character B (defender) with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and 1 rank in the longsword specifically. Meanwhile, character A doesn't have any ranks. Therefore, character B has more knowledge and experience in they type of attack and weapon, this knowledge increases the difficulty position of hitting character B by 1. Difficulty always starts at "Done!" (or position 0); thereby, increasing the difficulty to 2 (or position 1).

Let's take the same scenario and give character B (defender) two friends that must be considered while character A attacks. This might increase the difficulty position by 1 again; thereby, increasing the difficulty to 4 (or position 2).

Character A manages to hit character B. In the game we developed, longswords drain 2 points per hit. We aren't using the resistance extension; therefore, character B loses 2 points on their health battery.

It's recommended difficulty of combat not go above 8 without a supporting narrative. Therefore, whatever meathod is determined should consistently applied, known to the player(s), and be setting and theme appropriate; otherwise, it may feel like the physics of the setting and them are loose and this may not be fun for the player(s).

## Rewarding roleplaying

In roleplaying games, players may slip into metagaming. Metagames usually involve a player using knowledge they have to cause their character to act based on that knowledge, even if the character doesn't have that knowledge.

For example, character A is given a piece of knowledge about a secret room in the inn while away from Character B. Character A returns to character B who starts prodding character A to get that knowledge, which player A knows exists but character B does not. Or character B tries a contrived action to accidentally find the secret room.

Instead of trying to punish players for *not* roleplaying, Fourth Earth RAW gives multiple ways for the players and narrator to reward roleplaying as an out-of-character action. Of course, if the rewards are given at no cost, the gameplay could become boring; therefore, it's important everyone agree to the mechanics of this type of reward.

Maybe a claustraphobic character goes splunking and moves through a narrow passage. Due to the phobia, the difficulty was 10. The player acted out the anxiety, didn't spend any physical (or maybe in this case mental) battery points to reduce the level. The character made it through. Maybe the narrator rewards the player with battery points or an extra proficiency point to the skill. Maybe one of the other players transfers one of their battery points to the character.

So, while there isn't a specific mechanic meant to reward roleplaying by the players (or trading who owns the narration), the options are there and players (or the narrator) can tell the player, "This is for the killer roleplaying you just did."

## Conclusion

Fourth Earth RAW aims to allow you to easily create settings, with a them, and ability to populate them with sentient characters who interact with the world as played by players and growing while maintaining a sense of tension and incorporating strategic play.

Fourth Earth RAW has many extensions that help increase realism or solve specific player concerns. They are detailed in the "Extensions" chapter; these are descriptions only, not implementations, and may include suggestions on implemtenting them in a way the is consistent with the value and principles of Fourth Earth RAW.

Specific implementations of most of the extensions can be found in the other detailed Fourth Earth RAW expansions:

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided).

The expansions are less of a "blank canvas," each successive guide builds on the previous, and each looks to address problems and take advantage of more specific type of gameplay.

Thank you for making the time and considering Fourth Earth RAW. All feedback (and contributions) welcome. The easiest way to give feedback is to leave a [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbruce/fourth-earth-raw) issue and is where you can also see upcoming changes.

## References and inspirations

Fourth Earth RAW started from attempting to apply one or more of the following systems to the Fourth Earth setting and theme. There were parts of each system that we appreciated and some we didn't; it happens. We can't give full credit to any one system, we can't say we knew about each of them before making certain decisions, and we can't say we actually know the systems in their entirety. With that said, we can say if you don't like Fourth Earth RAW in its entirety, you might appreciate the following.
