# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling system for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences with the potential for unknown outcomes; it is:

- additive,
- rules-light, and
- action-oriented.

Being additive allows you to build stories by adding components. Components are made of guidelines, implementations, or both. Components give a starting point without overwhelming players (and narrators); compared to some systems which provide settings, characters, creatures, and mechanics. 

Rules-light means it describes gameplay possibilities more than establishing rules. 

Being action-oriented refers to the primary, generic mechanic for interacting with the setting; complexity is optional.

Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting. The overall system is applicable to:

- solo adventures (1 player of 1 or more characters, with or without a separate narrator), 
- tabletop (more than 1 player, with or without a separate narrator, possibly with the aid of a computer), and 
- computer-aided (the computer makes computation easier and may act as a proxy narrator).

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Narrators
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role-play over Grinding to become a demigod or metagaming
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge
7. Power ceilings over threat escalation

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and survive or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: There are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players may choose death or continuing with the same character, at a cost.

## Setting

Settings describe where, when, what, the theme, and possibly a high-level, central tension. The setting may include a specific, short-term plot (sometimes called an adeventure) or a generic, long-term campaign or be completely open for exploration. A theme establishes the type of sentient beings, technologies, and similar.

Guidelines:

1. Settings may come from the player(s), the narrator, the outside world (books, movies, purchased campaigns or adventures), or a combination.
2. The must be enough to give flavor and establish preliminary player expectations. 

Examples of settings include:

- Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, hospital camp, filled with ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mostly for healing and combat (a serial war story).
- Greek mythos, specifically The Underworld during the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demogods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
- Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

## Populating the setting

Characters include anything in the setting that can be played by the player(s), narrator, or both.

Implementation:

1. Must include a name that easily distinguishes one character from another.
2. Must have a health representing life force.
3. Should include at least one broader classification to group the character with similar characters.
4. Should favor nurture over nature regarding learnable qualities.

Cally the earthworm, for example.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

The health battery simulates the reality that most living things fade over time not in one hit, so to speak (see "Life batteries" section).

The first question to ask yourself is: Does your game involve permadeath or not?

Permadeath means death is considered a permanent state and there is no way to recover. For a player whose character has died to continue playing, they will need a new character. Permadeath can feel realistic and can be frustrating as the death of a character may feel like the result of a random roll of dice: “We could have done something more to save them.”

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated on a resolution to the question of permadeath beyond the aforementioned principle.

General guidelines:

1. There should be a way for the health battery to lose and gain points.
2. Favor “both way” solutions: If the battery can recharge over time, there should be a way for the battery to drain over time (starvation or poison, for example).
3. If the health battery can drain in chunks, there should be a way to recharge in chunks: A character hit for 3 points in 1 hit uses a healing potion that recharges 3 or more points in 1 use.

Guidelines for resurrection:

1. There should be a point where a character cannot be resurrected as their original self.
2. Resurrection should require an external force, not a roll by the player of a dead character: CPR, a defibrillator, a spell, an herb, whatever.
3. The character should experience a loss (simulating something like physical therapy or lack of oxygen).
4. The character awakens in the same place they died.

Consider:

- The health battery (or all batteries) are set to 1 (see “Life batteries” section).
- Any acquired ranks are reduced by 1 proficiency point (see “skills and tools” section). 
- Any physical near the character are immediately recoverable.

Guidelines for reincarnation:

1. Includes most guidelines for resurrection.
2. The loss may include the loss of all physical assets and lose more proficiency in skills than death alone: You can’t take it with you.
3. The character should awaken in a place other than where they died.

Consider:

- All life batteries are full.
- All ranks reduced by 2 proficiency points.
- All physical assets are no longer available. 
- The character is back in the location they started, or last rested, or some other relatively peacetime location.

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

The opposing force has qualities used to determine the difficulty. Decisions made by the player may reduce the difficulty level, increase the number of dice in the pool, and other considerations you may decide to include (see the "Difficulty" section).

Actions are considered resolved by answering at least the following:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider the following, separate actions: climbing a tree and attacking a rat, respectively.

The tree climb has an initial physical difficulty 6 (level 3) (see "Difficulty" secion). The player reduces the difficulty to 4 (level 2). That reduction came from spending one point from the physical battery; if the player had spent two more points, the difficulty would be 1 (level 0) - immediate success (see "Life batteries" section). The player decided to only spend one point, however; therefore, a dice pool of one or more dice is rolled (see "Dice pool" section). This character also has one rank in a climbing skill, which adds 1 die to their action pool (see "Skills and tools" section).

If the character succeeds in climbing the tree, they end up in the tree; if they fail, they stay on the ground. In either case, the action is resolved (see "Difficulty" section).

Let's switch to the rat, which has a physical difficulty 6; everything is the same as the tree climb. If the character succeeds, the rat is hit; if they fail, the rat is missed.

To remain simple, rules-light, and minimize context switching, Fourth Earth RAW strives to use this same mechanism for all interactions characters have with the setting and other characters. Details may change, but the flow remains the same: 

1. intent, 
2. difficulty, 
3. adjust, and
4. roll if necessary.

### Difficulty

Difficulty describes the opposing force for a given interaction.

Implementation:

1. Success is achieved by rolling a 1 on at least 1 die in the dice pool (see "Dice pool" section).
2. The difficulty rating system is based on the sides of dice to be rolled in the dice pool; levels and human-friendly names are also available.
3. Players should have access to (or the ability to) roll fair dice or coins with the filling sides: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20.

There are four ways to refer to the difficulty:

1. sides of dice in the pool,
2. level,
3. success probability, and
4. human-friendly label.

Guidelines:

1. Favor sides of dice when communicating difficulty to maximize communication while minimizing the need for cross reference and questions: "Roll d4 physical using your climbing skill."
2. Favor difficulty level when adjusting the difficulty; the level is typically the number of sides divided by 2. The exceptions [.d20](twenty-sided die) (level 7) and level 8 (no corresponding die).
3. Success probability is 1 out of the number of sides on the dice; also represented as 1/10 or 10 percent. 
4. Human-friendly labels may be used when a character wants to consider, internally, how difficult something might be: “I wonder how hard it’d be to climb that tree?” 

|Sides       |Level |Success probability |Human-friendly   |
|:----------:|:----:|:------------------:|:----------------|
| 1          | 0    |1/1                 |Done!            |
| 2          | 1    |1/2                 |Safe bet         |
| 4          | 2    |1/4                 |Simple           |
| 6          | 3    |1/6                 |Difficult        |
| 8          | 4    |1/8                 |Long shot        |
| 10         | 5    |1/10                |Leap of faith    |
| 12         | 6    |1/12                |Improbable       |
| 20         | 7    |1/20                |Inconceivable    |
| No Dice!   | 8    |n/a                 |Impossible, if not lowered |
| n/a        |infinity |0                |Impossible       |

Note: For the purposes of these chapters and sections referencing "difficulty" by itself uses "sides" while other references will be modified accordingly; "difficulty level," for example.

Further guidelines:

1. Favor setting difficulty based on an average character in the setting with flexibility to be more dynamic: stitch a finger might be d12 for the average person but a d4 for someone with related training or skills (see “Dice pools” section).
2. For d2 favor dice over coins and a roll of odd numbers over even: This maintains rolling 1 as the target, with the additional cognitive load not requiring a range, diving numbers, or similar. (There are fair two-sided dice available and favor the odd-even separation.)
3. When using human-friendly difficulty it may be worthwhile to choose one of the surrounding labels or difficulties, not the specific label or difficulty: This minimizes conversion and metagaming, helps drive tension through uncertainty, and opens the door for things like assessment and appraisal mechanics.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall health and vitality.

The maximum value of any life battery is 8.

The only life battery required by Fourth Earth RAW is the health battery. If the battery is reduced to and remains at 0, the character is dead (see “Populating the setting” and “Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation” settings).

The following guidelines relate to the number of batteries:

1. The higher the number of batteries, the harder they are to manage and the tension presented by actions becomes reduced.
2. Use overflow batteries where points from one or more other batteries can be converted to a single point in another battery; cost should be greater than reward, at least 2 points per 1 generated.
3. The health battery should not be available as an overflow.
4. Batteries can be added as gameplay proceeds based on actions taken; running might cause a "physical" battery to be needed, maybe a lot of characters are performing stealth-related skills, prompting the addition of a "stealth" battery.

Consider a 4 battery setup where the cost is the total number of overflow batteries; physical has 2 overflows and health has 3. 

Let's spend 1 point from the physical battery to reduce the difficulty level of climbing the tree; notice the character has 0 physical points available to start: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce difficulty) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

To raise the physical battery 1 point means draining 2 battery points from somewhere else.

Now consider a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1 (maybe the rat hit the character):

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the physical, mental, and spirit batteries (being exhausted is acceptable, being dead typically isn't). It costs 3 battery points to generate 1 point for the health battery.

Further guidelines:

1. Life batteries should recharge somehow; usually multiple ways. 
2. One or more recharging actions should be something the players can initiate: “I would like to rest.”
3. Points drained for conversion should rotate through overflow batteries. The target cost is more important than where the points came from; however, distributing the cost evenly is more important than player choice in this instance.

### Dice pools

Dice pools adjust success probability based on ranks in skills, tools, and similar modifiers (see “Skills and tools” section).

Implementation:

1. The dice pool always starts with 1 die; sometimes referred to as the base die.
2. Dice pools result from adding 1 to the total number of ranks related to the intent: “I get 1 more for a rank in climbing, another because I’m using a grappling hook, and an additional because my friends are cheering me on.”

Using percentages (instead of fractions) should make this easier to illustrate.

A difficulty 2 has a 50 percent success probability. If, however, there are two dice in the pool, the success probability becomes 75 percent. Or, consider a difficulty 20, which has a 5 percent success probability; 2 dice in the pool makes the success probability just under 10 percent.

Guidelines:

1. Player(s) and the narrator should determine the maximum dice in a pool, subtract 1 for the base die, and split the rest to create ranks. 
2. Dice pools should not exceed 5 dice: This allows space non-action dice. Further, more than 5 and the pools become unwieldy. Finally, more than 5 and the pool tends to cross the point of diminishing returns.

A difficulty 2 has a success probability of 50 percent. 5 dice in the pool makes this roughly 97 percent. To up the percentage to 99.9 requires an additional 5 dice. Put another way, starting from 50 percent a 47 percent increase took 5 dice while a 49.9 increase takes 10 dice. And, with that success probability, it might be easier for the narrator (or player in that role) to make the difficulty 1 (level 0); automatic success.

Further guidelines:

1. If ranks in skills and tools alone seems too restrictive, you can add other ways; the other guidelines remain.
2. Favor using a dynamic scale over adding dice beyond the initial 5. For example a 5 dice d20 pool has a success probability of roughly 23 percent; with 10 dice, the success probability would be 40 percent. A 5 dice d10 pool has a success probability of just over 39 percent (but less than 40.

## Movement

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated when it comes to movement.

Guidelines:

1. Compress the mundane; character wants to go from the gates of town to the inn, probably not necessary to roll every step of the way - could take an hour real-time for a five minute game-time walk.
2. Expand the marvelous; character is in a combat situation and wants to run a few meters away, probably not possible in one turn and could take several minutes in-real-time despite being second game-time.
2. Favor real-time over turn-based.

For example, a group of characters decide to walk five hundred kilometers (roughly three hundred miles) away. The average human walks five kilometers per hour (roughly three miles per hour) and can walk roughly ten hours per day; therefore, it will take them roughly ten days to get there. 

As the narrator (or player), unless otherwise agreed to, you might say, "Okay. That's going to take ten days. How often will you camp? Does anyone want to act anything out during the trip?" The narrator may decide to roll some dice a few times to see if anything of interest happens along the way; shoes fall apart, a bear wanders into camp on the third day, someone dies of dysentery, or maybe even something positive. In real-time this could take less than one minute but when they arrive, it's still: “10 days later...” If we weren’t compressing the mundane, each session played might represent one full day, which could feel like it’s dragging on and we could lose the morale of the players.

Conversely, when the characters get where they’re going thirty minutes of in-game time might take over an hour of real-time.

Guidelines:

1. Let narrative and character intent drive difficulty and what can be done in a turn or round. 

A player says their character is going to run the 500 kilometers back to a town and bring help?

Let's say the character is super fast, maybe the action (in total) is 4 sub-actions each with a difficulty 20 (level 7). Or, maybe being super fast is just inherent to the setting; the difficulty isn't isn’t the run, it’s convincing others to come help.

Another character in a different setting decides to move behind a target and subdue an oppoenent using a blackjack. Moving behind the target may be a difficulty 10 (level 5) and subduing with one blow of the blackjack is a difficulty 20 (level 7); hitting the target alone, without subduing in one hit, might be a difficulty 4 (level 2).

This approach helps maintain tension while respecting the setting.

## Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW has no predefined list of skills or tools.

Implementation:

1. Proficiency points are earned by successfully completing interactions with an initial difficulty level greater than the current rank achieved; therefore, reducing a difficulty level to 0, may still result in earning proficiency points. 
2. Proficiency points are added to the lowest unattained rank first. 
3. Skills always have ranks and tools usually have ranks. 

Consider a difficulty 1 (level 0); no proficiency points earned. Consider a difficulty 2 (level 1) and a character with no ranks whose player reduces the difficulty level to 0; 1 proficiency point is earned toward the first rank, which completes the first rank for that character. Consider a difficulty 2 (level 1) and the same character rolling 2 dice now; no proficiency point is earned - the rank corresponding to the initial difficulty is full. Consider a difficulty 6 (level 3) and the same character rolling 2 dice whose player reduces the difficulty to 4 (level 2); one proficiency point is earned toward the second (not third) rank because the second rank isn't full - if it were, the proficiency point would go toward the thrid rank.

Note: Lower-level ranks tend to be earned quickly. Partly due to filling up the lower-level ranks first and partly because of potential rarity of encountering higher-level difficulties.

Guidelines:

1. The number of proficiency points per rank should be greater than 1 and consistent across ranks.
2. Skills should have more ranks than most tools; unless the tool is particularly complex, specialized, or both. 
3. When characters succeed at something, they should be able to add it as a skill and gain ranks in it; similarly with found items used as tools (a rock as a hammer or bludgeoning weapon). We find this supports flow more than having a limited list from which to choose a subset - from which to decide on a specialty - before actually playing the game.
4. Proficiency points can be applied to skills and tools simultaneously. One d2 climbing action using a tool, might result in a proficiency point being added to the climbing skill and the tool despite only one action was performed.
5. Tools may decrease the difficulty level of an action; characters could widdle wood with their fingernails but it would be easier with a knife.

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the Earth, the grave digger should be afforded a slight advantage when using a shovel to destroy a zombie; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their skill in using bludgeoning attacks increases (see "Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation" section and "Becoming unskilled" extension). The digger may reduce their probabilities by switching from the shovel to a baseball bat or even more if switching to a gun (not a bludgeoning attack).

## Interacting with other living beings

For non-combat interactions, the players can negotiate with the narrator to determine the difficulty.

"I want to persuade this person to do this thing." The narrator might say, "That person didn't require persuasion (difficulty 1), they do it." Or, the narrator might say, "This person has special training against manipulation, roll mental d10 using persuasion" (presuming a mental battery and a persuasion skill); the player reduces and rolls as normal.

This way game mechanics can be generated just-in-time instead of constraining players and narrators to a finite list of specific interaction types.

Implementation:

1. Combat actions target the health battery directly (see “Populating the setting” section). 
2. Difficulty is derived from qualities of the defender to *evade* more than the attacker’s ability to hit (see “Difficulty” section).
3. Difficulty always starts at 1 (level 0)

Additional action guidelines related to combat:

1. Consistent method for calculating difficulty: Difficulty here is the difficulty of hitting that which was aimed at.
2. Consistent method for calculating points drained from the health battery. 
3. The methods chosen should prioritize most drastic increases in difficulty. 
4. Methods should avoid increasing complexity to maximize flow of action.
4. Methods should effect difficulty level not sides.
5. The initial difficulty level should rarely be above 8.

Consider character A attacking character B with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and 1 rank in the longsword specifically. Meanwhile, character A doesn't have any ranks. Therefore, character B has more knowledge and experience in this type of attack and weapon, this knowledge increases the difficulty level of hitting character B by 1: difficulty 2 (level 1).

Let's take the same scenario and give character B two allies who must also be considered while character A attacks. This might increase the difficulty level by 1 again: difficulty 4 (level 2).

Character A manages to hit character B. In the game we developed, longswords drain 2 points per hit. We aren't accouting for resistance, character B has 2 points drained from their health battery.

## Rewarding role-play

It has become something of a tradition for game masters, dungeon masters, narrators, and similar to devise to inspire or reward role-playing by players and to disincentive practices that detract or distract from the unscripted story players are playing (see “Player pacts” section). 

Rewarding role-play focuses on the player’s ability to perform as a character in the story despite being in a more omniscient position. 

Guidelines:

1. Favor rewarding role-play over punishing players for not.
2. Leverage available spend systems and mechanics before creating new ones: Extra proficiency points, battery point recharge, reduction in difficulty levels, and so on. 
3. Rewards should have a cost to the one giving the reward. 
4. Giving rewards should be available to players as well as narrators.
5. Rewards should *not* be used in a way that reduces or nullifies tension in the game. 

Maybe a claustraphobic character goes splunking and moves through a narrow passage. Due to the phobia, it's a difficulty 10. The player acted out the anxiety, didn't spend any physical battery points (or maybe in this case mental) to reduce it. The character made it through the passage. Maybe the narrator rewards the player with battery points or an extra proficiency point to the skill. Maybe one of the other players transfers one of their battery points to the character.

So, while there isn't a specific mechanism meant to reward role-playing by the players, the basic infrastructure exists to say, "This is for the killer role-playing you just did, thanks for making this fun."

## Player pacts

Up to this point we’ve primarily on players manipulating characters in a setting for the game. With the “Rewarding role-play” section we started bridging over to players (and narrators) interacting with each other based on playing the game. Player pacts focus on players (and narrators) interacting with each other.

If you are close friends with all the players, there may not be much benefit in establishing group norms and expectations; however, this may be the exception not the rule. Player pacts establish the physics of the collaboration and set expectations or establish answers to questions in a more timeless fashion.

A starter list of topics to consider:

1. Schedule:
	- Is this a one-shot or multi session?
	- How often do we meet? (Every Friday) What time? (Morning or evening)
	- What if I can’t make it? (Session cancelled, fallback players for characters, character is in stasis)
	- How often will breaks be taken? Are they set or loose?
	- How long is the session?
2. Style
	- In-person, virtual, whatever it takes?
	- Will it be recorded, streamed or published?
	- Theater of the mind, miniatures, live-action, or a combination?
4. Supplies
	- As a player, what do I bring? (Pencils, dice, miniatures, character sheets, et al)
5. “Table” etiquette and vibe 
	- Is eating or drinking permitted?
	- Standing and pacing versus sitting still?
	- Dark and brooding or bright and silly? (Similar with discussing theme, see the “Setting” section.)
	- What tools are okay? (Cellphone for character sheet and dice rolling)
	- what distractions (non-gameplay-related) are okay? (Cellphone for social media and messaging)
	- First aid and medical considerations of players?
	- Is it preferred players be referred as their characters, their names, or either dependent on circumstance?
6. Improving the experience 
	- How is inter-player conflict handled?
	- Will there be regular times for discussing how to improve gameplay and experience (or maybe the story)?
	- How does a player leave the fame with bailing (or ghosting)?
	- How do more players enter the group? Are they “permanent” players or a lending hand because they were the ride of another player?
7. Metagaming: a player uses knowledge they have about the game, the players, or through their table position to gain for their character in the game that the character does not have at the of advantage taking by the player:
	- What degree of metagaming is permitted, if at all?
	- How does your define metagaming?

In short, the players are establishing social norms and mores for interacting with one another in this context. Maybe when they’re “at the table” it’s presumed everything must be “in character” and “our of character” actions (including rolling) must be telegraphed by stepping “away from the table” - or maybe it’s presumed most table interactions are out of character. The difference between going to game night and having a normal conversation break out versus going to a social gathering and having to fights some orcs.

Addressing these questions up front can help smooth out a potentially bumpy road of “politely” going along to get along until someone stops being polite and starts getting real about how annoying the sound of popping g and clicking pens is to them. 

## Conclusion

Fourth Earth RAW aims to allow you to easily create settings, populate those settings, and afford characters played by players to strategically interact with and grow within that setting.

Fourth Earth RAW has multiple extensions to increase realism or solve specific concerns. They are detailed in the "Extensions" chapter; only guidelines, not implementations.

Expansions are considered sub-sets of the overall Fourth Earth RAW system. They are detailed in separate chapters, one for each expansion and include extension implementations that are in keeping with the values and principles of Fourth Earth RAW. Expansions include:

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided).

Fourth CA describes using a computer to aid both tabletop and video game style play.

Each successive expansion adds to the previous to address problems seen in those styles of play.

Thank you for making the time and considering Fourth Earth RAW. All feedback (and contributions) welcome. The easiest way to give feedback is to leave a [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbruce/fourth-earth-raw) issue and is where you can also see upcoming changes.

Fourth Earth RAW started from attempting to apply one or more of the following systems to the Fourth Earth setting. We appreciated parts and didn't appreciate parts; it happens. 

We can't give full credit to any one system, we can't say awareness of the system was known before implementation in Fourth Earth RAW, and we can't say we know the systems in their entirety. We *can* say, if you don't like Fourth Earth RAW in its entirety, you might appreciate the following.
