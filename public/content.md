# Fourth Earth RAW

The Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a game system which should allow for computer-aided, tabletop (pen and paper), and solo gameplay. It can be considered a rules-light, action-based system. It is rules-light insofar as the "rules" described here are more like minimal guidelines used to create characters and have those characters interact with the world and each other.

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Game Masters
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role play over Grinding to be demigod
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and hold their own or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: there are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation and there is no history of separatism and isolation from other species.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players should be allowed to choose death or continuing with the same character, at a cost.

## Creating a character

Choose a name appropriate to the setting.

Choose a species of sentient being available for play in the given setting.

All characters (and creatures) have at least one battery; health.

**Life batteries** are used to indicate that the character is alive and their points can be used to purchase reductions to challenge levels.

At this point a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

## Action (overview)

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force represented by the challenge level.

For every action we want to answer:

- Did the character succeed?
- (optionally) Was that success (of failure) critical in nature?
- How was the outside world affected?

There are four (or five) components to performing actions in Fourth Earth RAW:

- challenge levels,
- life batteries,
- proficiency in skills and tools, and
- dice pools.

**Challenge levels** range from 0 to infinite. An action with a challenge level of 0 means the chances of typical person succeeding at the action is virtually 100 percent. An action with a challenge level of infinite means it is literally impossible for a typical person (or current character) to succeed at the task. Between those extremes there are challenge levels from 1 to 8. The challenge level of 8 is also impossible, unless aided in some way. Challenge levels 1 through 7 have a decreasing probability of success represented by a standard coin or die:

|Generic name |Challenge level |Probability of success |Standard die or coin |
|:----|:--------------:|:---------------------:|--------------------:|
|Easy | 0              | 100 percent           | n/a                 |
|Safe bet | 1              | 50                    | [.d2](two-sided die or coin flip) |
|Simple | 2              | 25                    | [.d4](four-sided die)    |
|Difficult | 3              | ~17                   | [.d6](six-sided die)     |
|Long shot | 4              | ~13                   | [.d8](eight-sided die)   |
|Leap of faith | 5              | 10                    | [.d10](ten-sided die)    |
|Improbable | 6              | ~8                    | [.d12](twelve-sided die) |
|Inconceivable | 7              | 5                     | [.d20](twenty-sided die) |
|Impossible, if unaided | 8              | 0                     | n/a                      |
|Impossible |infinite        | 0                     | n/a                      |

Players can spend **life battery points** spend to reduce the challenge level of the action, which has a target life battery; one reduction per battery point spent. Tools may also reduce the challenge of tasks if applicable to the tool. If the challenge level is reduced to 0, the character succeeds, without criticality. If the challenge level is greater than 0, a roll to succeed is made.

There is always at least one die, the type of which is determined by the current challenge level, regardless of its initial challenge level. All actions should be traceable to a **skill**, each skill should allow for ranks in that skill, 1 die is added to the **dice pool** for each rank the character has in the skill.

The action is **successful** when at least 1 die in the pool has a value of 1. No matter how many dice are rolled, if there is a 1 present, the character succeeds; anything else is a failure.

### Criticality extension

Fourth Earth RAW separates the probability of success (or failure) and the probability of succeeding (or failing) critically.

If you would like to simulate the idea of a critical success or failure, we recommend adding another die to the pool that can be distinquished from the others in some way. If the value of this die is also a 1 after the roll, the success-fail outcome is considered critical. This roll does not change the outcome of the previous roll, just the serverity and possible side-effects.

If the success or failure was critical, you might have the player roll another standard die and use a table to determine what happened; of course, you can use anything really, maybe a card drawn from a deck. Heck you could even have the player describe the critical success or failure, "Wow, okay, you tell me what happened" style.

Again, the guideline here is that criticality does not change the success or failure outcome, just the severity and side-effects.

## Life batteries

Life batteries simulate a character's energy. As a game mechanic life batteries help generate tension between the player, their desire, and probabilities of success and failure. Life batteries have a maximum of 10 points. Points are spent when players reduce the challenge level of an action or when being damaged by someone or something.

If there are non-health batteries present, we recommend allowing their points to be converted into health battery points; 2 to 1 perhaps. The idea being that character's might be performing a physical action but have no physical energy left and they draw upon other parts of themselves to accomplish it; the character can only be at 0 after completely exhausting all other options. When using this overflow mechanic we recommend the cost per unit to the target battery be 2 or more. In some cases it might be more interesting to have the cost be the total number of overflow batteries. 

For example, consider 4 batteries. It takes 3 points to raise the health battery by 1; however, it only takes 2 points to raise another non-health battery by a point. Further, the spend is on a rotating basis, players don't get to choose, let's spend 1 point for an action targeting the physical battery:

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce challenge level) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

Note: The physical battery can remain at 0. You may have batteries, beyond health, that *cannot* stay at 0.

Consider taking a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1:

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

**Batteries are rechargeable** and may be based on in-game time, affecting one battery or all of them, something else entirely, or some combination. Whatever makes sense for the setting, players involved, and sub-mechanics. The only guideline is that players should have at least one way their characters can intentionally recharge their batteries.

### Draining health through combat

Involuntary draining of the health battery is classified as a combat action; falling out of a tree, for example. 

There is an attacker and defender, the former is trying to drain the health battery and the latter is trying to avoid that drain. The challenge level is derived from qualities of the defender and the attacker must overcome that challenge to possibly cause a drain on the defender. Therefore, the same mechanic for any action is used for combat.

If the attacker succeeds there is a potential drain that must be calculated in some standard way that players can anticipate; otherwise, it becomes very frustrated very quickly. To try and keep it cimple, the instrument of the attack should have a base drain amount (a), which can then be multiplied by the size difference between the attacker and defender (b) and incorporating any side-effects and criticality, if used: a * b + c

An attacker hits a defender with a spear that yields a 2 point drain per hit. The attacker is larger than the defender; therefore, the defender becomes 1 and we decide the attacker is 10 times larger: 2 * 10 + 0 = 20

Let's say the defender also only has one other battery. 10 points is drained from the health battery then the non-health batttery is drained by another 10 making its balance 0. The health battery is also at 0, the defender is dead.

**Subdue versus kill** is a decision players are allowed to make, so long as the facilitator allows that option. With the subdue option, the defender in the previous example would be given 1 point to their health battery. Then the character gets to make the decision on whether to deliver a killing stroke or not.

## Skills, tools, and dice pools

To allow skillsets to be built either from wholecloth or as the game is played based on its players and reduce analysis paralysis, there is no initial skill list provided.

Characters increase in proficiency of skills, represented by skill ranks. Ranks are increased by successfully completing actions related to that skill a standard number of times. The initial challenge level of the action must be greater than the number of ranks a character has in it; characters must push themselves in order to grow. Each rank adds one more die to the dice pool. 

It's recommended that skills be limited to 3 ranks or less because players are then rolling 4 dice in their pool. 4 dice against a challenge level one action changes a 50 percent chance of success to roughly 95 percent. If you decide to have more than 3 ranks, it is recommended that the basis for setting challenge levels shifts, maybe to the weakest character instead of an average being.

Tools should also efffect the challenge of a task as well; a character could widdle wood using their fingernails, but it would be easier with a knife. Tools are similar in skills in that characters improve proficiency in them. It is recommended to limit ranks in tools to 1 (earned the same way) and earning points toward a rank does not require using the tool for a specific purpose; could be 4 dice in the pool, 50 percent becomes roughly 97 percent.

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the earth, they should be afforded a slight advantage when braining a zombie; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their proficiency in using a bludgeon increase. The digger may also take a hit to their probabilities if they switch from the shovel to a baseball bat or even a gun.

Limiting ranks also keeps the number of dice in the pool manageable. However, if you're theme is superheroes or deities, increasing the ranks available might be helpful; 10 dice would change a 50 percent chance to roughly 100 percent (99.95). Of course, as stated before, challenge levels can also be dropped a bit; the challenge level for a flying superhero might be high at first but decreases to 0 zero the more they do it and it becomes just one more thing "they can just do."

Note: A roll is not required to eartn a proficiency increase and points and ranks are earned in succession. So, using batteries to reduce a level 3 challenge to 0 would result in a point gain and succeeding on an unreduced level 3 challenge would still earn one point on the first rank.

### Maintenance, degredation, and loss extension

Skills and tools require some type of maintenance if they are to last. To simulate this, you could introduce a degredation mechanic. If players don't perform a skill in a while, maybe they lose a rank or a point. Maybe a tool has a finite number of uses before the probability of it failing increases. Maybe this concept is tied with the critical failure path and it's a random loss of a rank or tool.

The underlying point being, buying a tool is typically not a one time affair and a tool that is used regularly rarely lasts forever, especially if the user does not actively maintain the tool in some way.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you're able to get a feel for the gameplay, mechanics, and constraints of Fourth Earth RAW. Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting, theme, and campaign. We hope you find it challenging, fun, and flexible where you need it to be. 

If you would like to see a full example of these rules expanded and used as the physics of a setting and theme, check out Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided) or Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), which are a little less of a blank canvas and also usable in your own stories.
