# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling system for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences and can be a framework to create game systems. 

Fourth Earth RAW specifically refers to the core guidelines and implementations described in this chapter and more generally includes additions and specifications captured in other chapters. 

Fourth Earth RAW, with or without a separate narrator, is applicable to:

- solo adventures (1 player of 1 or more characters), 
- tabletop (more than 1 player of 1 or more characters each, possibly with the aid of digital devices), and 
- digital-assist (1 or more players favoring digital solutions to facilitate gameplay).

This chapter is Fourth Earth RAW at its most raw, so to speak.

**Required equipment:**

1. A way to track the value of 1 or more life batteries.
2. A way to track proficiency points for ranks and the number of ranks.
3. A way to randomly select 1 or more distinguishable items from up to 12 otherwise indistinguishable items: dice, random number generators, 1 suit from a deck of playing cards with the king removed and drawing the ace is "rolling a 1," whatever is handy.

While dice are not specifically required, Fourth Earth RAW uses the language of dice for common reference.

**Values:**

1. Additive over Reductive: opportunities to opt-in to complexity instead of reducing to simplicity.
2. Narrative over Simulation: create stories more than replicate reality.
3. Flow over Grinding: don’t roll every step.
4. Power ceilings over Threat escalation: having saved the town, then the village, then the world, and now the universe what will they do next?
5. Progressive disclosure over Detail saturation: players should be able to start playing having never read the rules and specifications; learning them as they play.

**Principles:**

1. Player-generated characters are played with more care than system-generated characters.
2. Grinding to “level up” before joining friends, being jumped up levels without practice, or feeling like the low-level fifth wheel holding others back hinders enjoyment.
3. Narrators aren’t the enemy; more a label capturing responsibilities than a role given to an individual.
4. Requiring specialty equipment to play hinders playability and accessibility. 
5. The majority of characters view themselves as the protagonist (hero) of their own story.

**Terms:**

Common terms in the [.RPG](role playing game) community with Fourth Earth RAW definitions which may be uncommon.

- Player: A person playing 1 or more characters and executing game mechanics such as rolling dice. 
- Character: Anything in the setting that can be personified by the player(s).
- Narrator: One or more players who facilitate the story by purposefully introducing tension released by characters.
- Non-player character: A character existing outside of those played by the main group of players; often played by the narrator(s).
- Opposing character: Often a non-player character acting in opposition to the characters of the main group of players.
- Guideline: 1 or more recommendations for developing an implementation.
- Implementation: A specific method for executing a game mechanic. 
- Game mechanic: The mechanisms used by players to interact with characters and the game as well as how the game might respond to players and characters. 
- Grinding: Repeating an action at a nominal cost to increase character abilities to successfully complete or gain access to other content or resources; effectively correlating time-played with character ability or content access while not advancing the established or generated plot for the character.
- Metagaming (colloquial): Using information the player has to affect character decisions without the character first acquiring that information.
- Railroading: Players feel they aren’t given a choice, their choices don’t affect the path of the story and setting, or choices offered tend to be singular or false dichotomies.
- Role playing: 
	- Making decisions the player would make in similar circumstances as the character. 
	- Making decisions an idealized version of the player would make in similar circumstances as the character.
	- Making decisions the player would *not* make because it’s a decision the character would make given the circumstances.

## Setting

Settings describe where, when, what, and the theme the characters exist within. The setting may include a specific, short-term plot (sometimes called an adventure or quest); a generic, long-term campaign; be open for exploration with no predetermined story; or, a combination.

Guidelines:

1. Settings may come from the player(s), narrator, outside world (books, movies, purchased campaigns or adventures), or a combination.
2. There must be enough to give flavor and establish preliminary player expectations; the rest can be built as play proceeds. 

Consider:

- Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, hospital camp, filled with ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mainly for healing (a serial war story).
- Greek mythos, specifically The Underworld during the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demigods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
- Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

## Characters

Characters include anything in the setting that can be personified by the player(s).

Guidelines:

1. Should include at least 1 broader classification to group similar characters: female, elderly, elf.
2. Should favor nurture over nature regarding learnable qualities.
3. Should be played by same player with every appearance; unless players have agreed on alternatives (see "Player pacts" section).
4. Should have a unique name to distinguish characters from one another. 

Implementation:

1. Must have 1 or more life batteries (see “Life batteries” section).

Consider:

Cally the earthworm with a health battery, for example.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's life force using battery points. 

Guidelines:

1. Each battery should have the same maximum battery points.
2. The number of life batteries should be minimal as each increases overhead and tends to reduce tension in action performance.
3. Life batteries should recharge; usually in multiple ways. 
4. One or more ways to recharge should be something players can initiate: “I would like to rest.”
5. Favor “both way” solutions; if the battery can recharge over time, it should be able to drain over time (starvation or poison, for example).
6. Batteries can be added as you play; maybe a lot of characters are performing stealth-related actions prompting the creation of a "stealth" battery.
7. All characters should start with the same (or similar) set of batteries operating with the same implementation.

Implementation:

1. 1 battery must exist.
2. Characters are considered dead when a specific life battery is reduced to 0 or all life batteries are reduced to 0.
3. Some player decisions, character actions, and other components of the setting should drain 1 or more battery points from 1 or more life batteries.

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

Implementation: 

Action resolution has at least the following phases: 

1. character intent, 
2. assigned difficulty using qualities of  the opposing force (see “Difficulty” section), 
3. opportunity for the player to reduce difficulty (if reduction is available), and 
4. player dice roll, if applicable.

Actions are considered resolved when at least the following questions are answered:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider:

Character A wants to climb a tree with a difficulty 3 (see "Difficulty" section).

The system we're using allows players to spend life battery points to reduce difficulty. If the player spends 3 points, the character succeeds automatically. 

The player only spends 1, making the difficulty 2. 

Because the difficulty is greater than 0 after reduction, a dice pool is rolled. There is always 1 die available (see "Dice pool" section). Character A has 1 rank in climbing, which adds another die to the pool (see "Ranks" section); player rolls [.2d4](two four-sided dice).

If the character succeeds in climbing the tree, they end up in the tree; if they fail, they stay on the ground (see "Difficulty" section). Either way, the action is resolved. 

How about attacking a rat? The calculated difficulty for hitting the rat is 3; everything is the same as climbing tree tree. 

If the character succeeds, the rat is hit; if they fail, the rat is missed.

To remain simple, rules-light, and minimize context switching, Fourth Earth RAW strives to use this same mechanic for all opposed interactions a character has with the setting and characters.

### Difficulty

Difficulty is based on qualities of the opposing force for a given interaction.

Implementation:

1. Success is achieved by rolling a 1 on at least 1 die in the dice pool (see "Dice pool" section).
2. Difficulty levels range from 0 to infinity; where 0 is automatic success and infinity is strictly impossible.
3. Difficulty levels have an inner range of 1 through 7; the result of doubling the level is the number of sides for the dice in the pool; difficulty 7 is impossible unless reduced as there is no standard die with 14 sides.
4. Players should be able to create groups of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 similar items and randomly select at least 1 unique item: 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-sided dice. 

There are four standard ways to refer to difficulty:

1. level (most common), 
2. sides of dice (upper limit),
3. base success probability, 
4. human-friendly label, and 
5. opposing level.

| Level | Sides | Base success probability | Human-friendly | Opposing level |
|:--:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| 0 | 0 | 1/1 | Done! | Infinity |
| 1 | 2 | 1/2 | Safe bet | 7 |
| 2 | 4 | 1/4 | Simple | 6 |
| 3 | 6 | 1/6 | Difficulty | 5 |
| 4 | 8 | 1/8 | Long shot | 4 |
| 5 | 10 | 1/10 | Leap of faith | 3 |
| 6 | 12 | 1/12 | Inconceivable | 2 |
| 7 | No dice! | n/a | Impossible, if not lowered | 1 |
| Infinity | n/a | 0 | Impossible | 0 |

Further guidelines:

1. Favor assigning difficulty based on an average character in the setting with the option of being character-specific: stitching a finger might be difficulty 6 for the average person but a difficulty 2 for someone with related training (see “Dice pools” section).
2. For difficulty 1, favor dice over coins and a roll of odd numbers over even; maintains rolling 1 or recognizing odd numbers as opposed to dividing, remembering ranges, or similar solutions.
3. Human-friendly labels are typically used during character introspection, "This seems like a safe bet"; to add tension and simulate under- or over-estimating one's abilities, it might be useful to give a label near the difficulty rather than exactly on it.

### Dice pools

Dice pools adjust success probability based on ranks (see “Ranks” section). 

“Dice pool” is a slight misnomer as it’s not required to roll the same number of dice in the pool at once, you can roll the same die once for every die in the pool.

Implementation:

1. The dice pool always starts with 1 die; sometimes referred to as the base die.
2. Ranks are the primary way to increase the number of dice in the pool: “I get 1 more for a rank in climbing, another because I’m using a grappling hook, and an additional die because my friends are cheering me on.”

Consider:

Difficulty 1 has a 50 percent (1/2) base success probability; with 2 dice in the pool, the actual success probability is 75 percent.

Difficulty 6 has roughly an 8 percent base success probability; with 2 dice, it's roughly 16 percent.

Guidelines:

1. When customizing the system￼, the player(s) and the narrator(s) should determine a maximum dice pool, subtract 1 for the base die, and split the rest to create ranks. 
2. Dice pools should not exceed 5 dice to: 
	- allow space for non-action dice, 
	- keep the pool more physically manageable when using dice, and
	- account for diminishing returns for pools of more than 5. 

Consider:

Difficulty 1, base success probability of 50 percent.

5 dice in the pool and success probability becomes roughly 97 percent. A success probability of 99.9 percent requires an additional 5 dice in the pool (10 in total). 

Put another way, doubling the dice in the pool is an increase of 2.9 percent (compared to 47 percent with the first 5). It may be more beneficial to lower the difficulty to 0.

## Interacting with characters

Role playing interactions with other characters is left to the players, this section discusses interactions where dice are used to resolve an intent opposed by another character. 

Guidelines:

1. Difficulty is derived from qualities of the opposing character; if the target character chooses not to oppose whatever the other character is attempting, the difficulty is 0. 
2. The implementation should apply difficulty modifiers starting with greatest impact first and stop as soon as difficulty reaches 7.
3. Implementations should adjust difficulty level not another quality of difficulty.

Consider:

Player A wants character A to persuade character B to do something.

In one scenario, player B, who is playing character B says, “I’m okay with that.” Difficulty becomes 0, no calculations or rolls necessary. 

In another scenario, player A is playing character A and the narrator is playing character B, both of whom are international spies. 

Character A is tied to a chair and badly beaten. Character A is attempting to persuade character B to let them go. Character B is trained against manipulation. With this training and having a severe advantage, the difficulty for the persuasion is 7 (if not infinity).

Implementation (combat):

1. Difficulty refers specifically to difficulty to hit; therefore, qualities used to calculate difficulty help the defender evade, not block or absorb (see Fourth Earth RAW: Additions "Resistance" section).

Consider:

Character A attacking character B with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and another in longsword specifically. The implementation being used makes hitting character B a difficulty 2 (1 per rank).

Let’s give character B two allies, which character A must consider while trying to hit character B. This might increase the difficulty 1; now 3.

Character A manages to hit character B. In the game we developed, longswords drain 2 points per hit; character B has 2 points drained from 1 of their life batteries.

## Ranks

Ranks serve two primary purposes:

1. represent character improvement (progression) through intentional action and
2. a way of increasing success probability.

Proficiency is a complex matter with many factors to try and simplify; how much does one learn from:

- outright success,
- reflecting on one's own failures, and
- watching others failing compared to succeeding?

Guidelines:

1. Earning ranks should require 2 or more proficiency points and be achievable in roughly 4 attempts (using the highest proficiency point gain).
2. When using both success and failure, the number of proficiency points earned should be different for success and failure; with the understanding that failure will most likely occur more often than success in the beginning (see Fourth Earth SA).
3. When using success only, players should be able to reduce difficulties somehow (see Fourth Earth RAW: Additions “Difficulty reduction” section); this is not recommended when using failure only.
4. The implementation should be stable for the entire session or across multiple sessions as it may be beneficial to favor failure when introducing a new character to an already existing group of characters.
5. Ranks should be earned as play proceeds to give characters immediate benefit for "learning on the job" as opposed to waiting for a "leveling up" session or time.

Implementation:

1. Ranks are achieved by earning proficiency points; proficiency points are earned by characters performing actions they succeed or fail at. 
2. Proficiency points are added to the lowest unattained rank first.
2. Proficiency points are earned by succeeding or failing difficulties greater than the rank of the character for that difficulty.

Consider:

In their solo adventuring game, Player A has character A earn 1 proficiency point upon success. Character A has achieved multiple ranks in various skills. 

Player A invites Player B to join with a newly created character B, who has no ranks.

To minimize complexity and maximize growth for character B, player A and B agree to favor proficiency on failure this session; 2 points on failure and 1 point on success. Each rank requires 4 points.

Character A has 1 rank against a difficulty 1, they succeed and earn 0 proficiency points; the initial difficulty was not greater than their current rank. 

Character B has 0 ranks against the same action, they fail and earn 2 proficiency points (halfway to the rank of character A).

Character A is attempting something they have 1 rank in, adding 1 die to the pool (see "Dice pool" section); the difficulty is 3. Character A succeeds, earning 1 proficiency point toward the second rank (still progressing while not effectively abandoning character B). 

By the end of the session both players were able to progress in the story and setting. Character A was able to progress in rank possibly at a slightly slower pace than normal. Character B was able to progress in rank much faster than they otherwise would have.

In the next session, player A teaches player B how they normally play, which is:

- 1 proficiency point on success (no change),
- no points on failure (change), and 
- the ability to reduce difficulty levels by spending battery points (new).

Further guidelines:

1. At minimum, ranks should be earned using skills based on character action.
2. The number of proficiency points per rank should be consistent across all rank-able aspects of the character; not 4 for these ranks, 2 for those, 8 for those.
3. Earning 1 proficiency point may increase multiple rank-able aspects of the character simultaneously; 1 point added to each affected rank. 

## Time and space

How are real-time and game-time related? Is there a strict calendar?

How much space can a character cover in a given amount of time in a given circumstance (movement)? 

Do characters age? Does that aging occur even when the character is not being actively played? Can a character die while the player is away?

Guidelines:

1. Compress what players consider the mundane ("grinding") and expand what they consider the marvelous.
2. Favor cinematic over real-time.
3. Favor real-time over turn-based.
4. Be fluid based on narrative.

Consider: 

Character A just arrived at the gates of a fairly safe and mundane town. Character A wants to go to the inn 1 kilometer away. Of the following implementations, tend toward the first:

1. There’s a 10 percent chance something interesting will happen in that distance over time. [.1d10](one ten-sided die) is rolled, nothing interesting happens and character A arrives at the inn without incident. The walk took less than 1 minute real-time and roughly 15 minutes game-time.
2. 1 kilometer will be roughly 1,200 steps. Each step will be given a difficulty based on terrain, distractions caused by the surroundings (mainly the smell of pastries), and crowd density. The players wait as difficulty calculations are made for all 1,200 steps, if difficulty is 1 or higher, players reduce difficulties and roll dice, followed by narration of outcomes along with detailed descriptions of every shopfront. This could take over 1 hour real-time and cover the same 15 minutes game-time.

Both versions track the character from the gates to the inn with the possibility of something interesting happening between here and there. Both also *feel* very different from the player perspective. 

In the first, the journey as a whole was given a probability for something interesting to happen (good or bad). In the second, each step was given a difficulty (most were 0 and all were probably less than 5, depending on how good the pastries smelled that day). If the character were encumbered somehow or inebriated, the second implementation might feel less like “rolling for simulation sake.”

Now, character A is at the pub when a fight breaks out; character A wants no part of it. They decide to walk from the bar to the exit. 

Under mundane circumstances real-time and game-time would almost be in sync; however, in a brawl it might take character A 2 or 3 turns (5 or 10 minutes real-time) as they avoid being pulled into the fight and watch for flying objects.

Having made it to the exit, character A realizes they forgot their hat at the bar. The fight is dying down and a path is clear between the door and the part of the bar where the hat was. 

Unfortunately character B appears to have claimed the hat as their own. A look from character B indicates character A isn't getting it back without a fight. Character A decides to walk over, throat-punch the stranger, take the hat, and walk out. 

We decide character A can overcome a single difficulty 6 action to execute the entire plan (treating the plan as more mundane); or, it will take 1 turn to get there, another to punch character B (a difficulty 3 action), and a third turn to be back at the door (treating the plan as more marvelous).

At the height of the brawl, it took 3 turns just to walk to the door.

Guidelines (decomposition and decay):

In life, tools decay, skills atrophy without use or practice, and people age; even mountains erode.

1. Favor gradual over drastic decomposition: human-made buildings will fall but rarely without an outside force or a chain of events starting from an initial failure. 
2. There should be maintenance actions characters can take (or points players can earn and spend) to reduce any applied rate of decomposition: changing fluids for a combustion motor.
3. Establish life expectancies at the moment of creation.

Consider:

Character A has 1 rank in a skill with 2 more proficiency points in the same skill. Character A hasn’t used that skill in a while and is asked to remove 1 proficiency point. 

## Player pacts

To use the parlance of our time, player pacts are the terms of service for the game.

If Fourth Earth RAW describes the physics for interacting with the setting, player pacts describe the physics for collaboration and communication between players; establishing social norms and mores to set baseline expectations, boundaries, and accommodate player needs.

Pacts don’t need to be formally written and signed like legal contracts; however, players may find it useful to write them down for easy reference and modification later. Groups of players who are close friends or have played together for years with established, rarely forgotten norms and mores could be an exception; until a new player arrives. 

Guidelines:

1. Any list of written pacts should be short; possibly limited to those things that are most often forgotten or are considered dealbreakers.
2. Dealbreaker pacts should be told to new members at minimum. 

Consider:

Reference preference: How should people be referred (character name, legal name, either based on content and context, pronouns)? 

Session schedule: When can I arrive? When does play begin? When does play end? When do I need to leave? How long is the session? Will there be breaks? How rigid or fluid is time kept? 

Gaming schedule: Is this a one-shot (1 session, less than 2 hours), adventure (1 or 2 sessions, 4 to 6 hours), or campaign (3 or more sessions, 12 or more hours)? How likely are characters to die (should 1 or 2 backup characters be prepared)? Is this more about gathering with friends regularly or about playing the game regularly? How often do we meet and when? What if I can’t make it (character in safety bubble, played by agreed upon fallback player, session rescheduled)?

Preparedness: What are players expected to bring? What should be provided by the host? Do players have specific needs (standing up to think, visual impairments, first aid and medical needs)?

“Table” etiquette: Is eating and drinking at the table okay? What tools are allowed (digital devices to roll dice)? What non-game distractions are permitted (social media)? What’s the tone of the table (idle chitchat with the game as a secondary activity, or vice versa)?

Gameplay: Is it in-person, virtual, hybrid? Are sessions recorded, streamed, published? Theater of the mind, miniatures, live-action, hybrid? Silly, serious, somewhere in-between? What are your thoughts and considerations around metagaming and railroading? Are there subjects that should be avoided in the game content?

Changed: How do pacts get changed? How often can pacts change? How is inter-player conflict handled? What happens when players leave? What happens when players join?

Addressing these questions up front can help smooth out a potentially bumpy road of “politely” going along to get along until someone stops being polite and starts getting real about how annoying the sound of popping gum and clicking pens is to them. 

## Conclusion

Fourth Earth RAW aims to allow you to focus on setting and characters rather than game mechanics while affording players the opportunity to strategically interact with the setting through their character(s) who, in turn, grow within the setting.

Fourth Earth RAW has multiple additions to add nuance and resolve specific concerns. Various guidelines, not implementations, are in the Fourth Earth RAW: Additions chapter.

Specifications wrap the core Fourth Earth RAW system and offer specific implementations for various additions tailored to specific contexts. Specifications include:

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.DA](digital assisted).

Each successive specification wraps the previous.

Fourth Earth DA describes using digital tools to aid both tabletop and video game play.
