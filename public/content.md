# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling framework for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences with the potential for unknown outcomes; it is:

- additive,
- rules-light, and
- action-oriented.

Additive means it's designed to allow you to build into stories by adding pieces not explicitly spelled out; contrasted by systems that provide creatures, settings, and the mechanics to sift through and use or modify. It is rules-light in that it's more informational with a minimal mechanic instead of having multiple mechanics or mechanics with multiple steps to implement. It is action-oriented because the primary mechanic affords players a generic way to interact with the world; complexity is optional.

The system should be applicable to:

- solo adventures (one player of one or more characters, with or without a separate narrator), 
- tabletop (more than one player, with or without a separate narrator, possibly with the aid of a computer), and 
- computer-aided in either an A-B storyline or open world gameplay style (the computer acts as the narrator and makes the math easier).

Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting, theme, and campaign.

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Narrators
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role play over Grinding to become a demigod or metagaming
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and hold their own or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: there are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation and there is no history of the setting built in.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players should be allowed to choose death or continue with the same character, at a cost.

## Creating the setting

The characters exist within one or more settings and there is a theme to the world. (A high-level central tension may also be helpful to increase drama and tension.) The setting, theme, and storyline may be developed by the narrator (the omniscient perspective), by the players in collaboration with the narrator, or any combination that establishes one or more of the following:

1. Where does the story take place (jungle, city, desert, ship)?
2. What level of technology exists (advanced non-combat technology and archaic tools made with advanced materials)?
3. The governing structures pertinent to the story?

It doesn't need to be in-depth at the beginning, just enough to give a flavor to the world; something like the following would work:

1. A one-shot story in a mundane world filled with ordinary people (a situational comedy or drama).
2. A serial in the spiritual plain filled with deities and demons (mythology).
3. Or even a mundane world filled with ordinary people and the occassional deity or demon (super heroics).

The part following the "filled with" phrase establishes the foundation of the theme. Again, this does not need to go in-depth, just enough to give everyone a common ground from which to begin.

## Populating the setting

All living beings abide by the same rules of creation and action.

Living beings have a setting- and theme-appropriate:

1. name to easily identify that living being.
2. type for the life form.

Cally the earthworm, for example.

All living beings have at least one life battery representing their current health with a maximum value of 10.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

Living things die, it's the trade-off of life. The health battery simulates the reality that most living things fade over time not in one hit, so to speak. If the health battery reaches and reamins at 0, the living thing is dead.

The first question to ask yourself is: Is this game a permadeath game?

Permadeath means death is considered a permanent state and there is no way to recover. If you want to keep playing, a new character is needed. This can feel realistic and at the same time can be very frustrating as games do not accurately simulate life. Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated on a resolution to this question; just offers some thoughts to cover various scenarios.

Generally, regardless of setting or theme, there should be a way for the health battery to recharge. If using time passed, the game simulates unassisted regeneration; the health battery just gradually increases over time until fully recharged. If using items or magic, the game simulates (or uses) assisted regeneration like medicine; the health battery might increase in a large chunk before gradually filling the rest of the way.

Resurrection, as a term, means the health battery has hit 0 but some external force has caused the health battery to return to 1 or more. In a mundane game (thinking in terms of television shows and movies) this could simulate CPR or the defibrilator paddles - clear! In a fantasy adventure game this could be something like magic. The recommendation here is that the character should experience some type of loss to simulate things like physical therapy, lack of oxygen to the brain for extended periods, and so on. As a game mechanic this is meant to instill a sense of caution in players; death may not be permanent but there will be a setback (starting at the beginning of a level).

Reincarnation, as a term, means the health battery hit 0, no external force caused the health battery to return to 1 or more, and the player has decided to continue playing the character anyway. This simulates the actual belief of reincarnation as much as is practical given the constraints of a game. The recommendation here is a loss that is greater than resurrection and usually sees the player starting in a position different than where they died. It's recommended that the loss include the loss of all physical posessions; the soul left the physical realm and the character may be recognized as the one who died but doesn't inherit the belongings of the past self.

Consider the following example:

|Type of recovery |Life batteries |Skills |Tool poficiency |Physical goods |
|:----------------|:--------------|:------|:---------------|:--------------|
|Resurrection     |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 1 point |All ranks reduced by 1 point |Still around or recoverable |
|Reincarnation    |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 2 points |All ranks reduced by 2 points |No longer available |

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

The opposing force is represented by a challenge level which is based on qualities of the opposing force and then overcome by the character attempting the action. 

For an action to be considered resolved, we must answer all of the following questions:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider the following, separate actions: climbing a tree and attacking a rat, respectively.

The tree climb starts as a challenge level of 3; roughly a 17 percent chance of success. The player chooses to reduce the challenge level by spending 1 point from an associated battery (1 level per point drained); making the challenge level 2, a 25 percent chance of success. If the challenge level is reduced to 0, the climb is successful; otherwise, a dice pool of 1 or more dice is rolled.

There is always at least 1 die in the pool. The number of dice can be increased by achieving ranks in skills; 1 extra die per rank. This character has 1 rank in climbing, which brings the number of dice in the pool to 2; roughly a 43 percent chance of success. To succeed, at least 1 die in the pool must have a value of 1 when rolled; to rephrase, the target to be rolled is at least one 1 regardless of the number of dice in the pool.

Upon failure or success, there should be a side-effect impacting the character, outside world, or both. In the case of climbing the tree, the character either remains where they were or makes it up the tree on failure or success, respectively.

Let's consider the rat, which has a calculated challenge level of 3 based on various characteristics. Everything is the same as the tree climb. Upon failure or success, the side-effect will be missing the defender or hitting.

This means there is no secondary action system for combat (or anything else). All actions happen in the equivalance of real time (there is no initiative in the base Fourth Earth RAW system); intent, challenge level, roll. Having only one action system reduces the need for context switching by players.

### Challenge levels

Challenge levels describe the probability of success for an action and always have a target battery that can be used to reduce the level. 

The scale begins with 0, representing 100 percent chance of success (or at least greater than 50 percent chance). The scale ends at infinity, representing completely impossible in the setting. Standing up or walking might be 0 for an adult compared to a baby while drawing a laser sword in a medieval setting might be infinite.

The inner range is from 1 through 8. 8 is impossible without some form of assistance; climbing a potruding ice wall, in rain and heavy winds, with no tools. Challenge levels 1 through 7 have a decreasing probability of success represented by a standard coin flip or die roll:

|Generic name           |Challenge level |Probability of success |Standard die or coin               |
|:----------------------|:--------------:|:---------------------:|----------------------------------:|
|Easy                   | 0              | 100 percent           | n/a                               |
|Safe bet               | 1              | 50                    | [.d2](two-sided die or coin flip) |
|Simple                 | 2              | 25                    | [.d4](four-sided die)             |
|Difficult              | 3              | ~17                   | [.d6](six-sided die)              |
|Long shot              | 4              | ~13                   | [.d8](eight-sided die)            |
|Leap of faith          | 5              | 10                    | [.d10](ten-sided die)             |
|Improbable             | 6              | ~8                    | [.d12](twelve-sided die)          |
|Inconceivable          | 7              | 5                     | [.d20](twenty-sided die)          |
|Impossible, if unaided | 8              | 0                     | n/a                               |
|Impossible             |infinite        | 0                     | n/a                               |

In general, the scale uses an average person in the world and common actions; however, to keep things challenging for the characters in the setting and based on the theme, a more relative scale might be beneficial. For example, character A decides they want to attempt stitching a wound in a finger, they are not a doctor and have no training, probably a challenge level of 4 or higher. Alternatively, character A who has training in veterinary medicine might receive a challenge level of 2 or 3. Or, in a mundane world unassisted flight would be infinite, but the character becomes super with the ability to fly, the first time might be a 4 and eventually becomes a 0.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall health and vitality.

The maximum value of any life battery is 10.

The only life battery required by Fourth Earth RAW is the health battery. If the battery is reduced to and remains at 0, the character is dead.

Your game may have any number of batteries, with the following recommendations in mind:

1. The higher the number of batteries, the harder they are to manage and the amount of tension in the action economy is reduced.
2. Use overflow batteries where points from one or more other batteries can be converted to a single point in another battery; cost should be greater than reward, at least 2 points per 1 generated.
3. The health battery should not be available as an overflow.

Consider a system where the cost is the total number of overflow batteries; physical has 2 overflows and health has 3. 

Let's spend 1 point from the physical battery to reduce the challenge level of climbing the tree; notice the character has 0 physical points available to start: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce challenge level) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

To raise the physical battery 1 point means converting 2 battery points pulled on a rotating basis from the other batteries. The target cost is more important than where the points came from; however, distributing the cost evenly is more important than player choice in this instance.

Now consider taking a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1 (maybe the rat hit the character):

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the physical, mental, and spirit batteries. It costs 3 battery points to generate 1 point for the health battery.

Life batteries should recharge somehow; usually multiple ways. At least one of these recharging actions should be something the characters can initiate. For example, a "mundane game" (as opposed to an "action-adventure" game), might see a character fall from a ladder and have their health battery drained by 3. Maybe they go to sleep. Maybe they take some medicine. Maybe they go to the hospital. Maybe they do some combination.

### Dice pools

Dice pools further adjust the probability of success for a given action.

A level 1 challenge has a 50 percent probability of success. If the dice pool has 2 dice instead of 1 the probability of success becomes 75 percent.

Adding dice is done through skill ranks related to a given action, tool, or both. Therefore, the dice pool is 1 base die, plus the number of ranks in a skill, plus the number of ranks in a tool, plus any additions you decide to add. 

It's recommended that the number of dice in a pool not surpass 5. More than this and the pool starts becoming unmanageable and crosses the point of diminishing returns. 5 dice in a pool for a level 1 challenge results in a roughly 97 percent chance of success. To overcome the last 3 percent requires doubling the pool (10 dice). It took 4 dice to go from 50 percent to 97 percent and another 5 to go from 97 to 99.9. 

There may be instances where larger dice pools may seem to make sense. Consider a challenge level 7 action with a dice pool of 5, probability of success is roughly 23 percent; if the pool hd 10 dice it would be a 40 percent chance. However, maybe for a super human the challenge level isn't 7, maybe it's a 5, which would also be a 40 percent chance with only 5 dice in the pool.

For details on ranks see the "Skills and tools" section.

## Movement

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated when it comes to movement beyond creating a desirable experience for those involved. In the type of games most likely to use Fourth Earth RAW, there's a spectrum for space-time.

One end is real time simulation; a minute in-game is a minute in-real-life, a mile in-game is a mile in-real-life. We might see the other end as battle simulation and tends to feel more like playing chess; players may take hours to move and may have conversations their characters couldn't in the heat of battle. In the former, the player is the character and in the latter the player is more of a storyteller and puppetmaster. The former may be represented as live-action-role-playing and the latter might be represented as a turn-based tabletop roleplaying game with miniatures.

Fourth Earth RAW slants more toward real time simulation while using dice roll resolution to allow for theater of the mind instead of live-action or miniatures:

1. Make a declaration of what characters are doing.
2. Roll the dice pools.
3. Resolve the outcome.

This means time will scale based on what is happening to compress the mundane. Long, mundane travel over great distances are compressed to be as short as possible real time. Surgical, marvelous actions are inverted. In either case, it can be a good idea to let players know how much in-game time has passed.

For example, a group of characters decide to walk to a location roughly 500 kilometers (~300 miles) away; they want to do this by foot. The average human walks 5 kilometers per hour (~3 miles per hour) and can walk roughly 10 hours per day; therefore, it will take them roughly 10 days to get there. 

As the narrator (or player), unless otherwise agreed to, you might say, "Okay. That's going to take 10 days. How often will you make camp? Does anyone want to act anything out during the trip?" and so on. The narrator may decide to roll some standard die a few times to see if there are any hazards experienced by the characters; shoes fall apart, a bear wanders into camp, someone dies of dysentery, or maybe even something positive. In real time this could take less than one minute but when they arrive, it's still: 10 days later...

Game-time and real time will most likely invert when the characters go inside wherever it is they've arrived to. Details about the setting are given, explored, considered, discussed. It may take hours of real time to do 30 minutes of game-time activities. Let the narrative and intent of the characters drive any challenge levels for actions. 

A player says their character is going to run the 500 kilometers back to a town and bring help? Challenge level of infinite; unless they're super fast, then maybe it's 4 actions each at a challenge level of 8. Or, if that's literally just what they do and everyone agrees they can run 500 in two seconds, the challenge might be getting help back (convince the citizens to action). 

Another player says their character is going to get behind a target (to gain an advantage) and knock them out with their blackjack? Maybe it's a challenge level of 5 for the movement and then hitting the target has a challenge level of 8 because the intent isn't just to hit but to subdue in one shot.

Warp drive and the transporter are what makes space travel exciting, compress the mundane. But sometimes characters will want to play chess and practice defending themselves to enrich their characters and improve the audience experience.

## Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW seeks to be a generic system that allows for rapid start and evolution; therefore, there is no predefined set of skills and tools. Further, the presumption is that any character can attempt anything, only the probabilities of success are changed. When a character attempts something, capture that as a skill, let them gain ranks in it. If another character wants to try the same thing, let them add that to their list of skills, and gain ranks in it. We find this beats having a large list of skills and having to choose a subset to become practiced in.

The maximum dice in a dice pool is bound by the maximum number of ranks in total for skills, tools, and any other contributing factors.

Every successful attempt of an action with a challenge level greater than the current rank adds 1 point toward the next rank; this implies there is no rationel for having total rank counts greater than 7 or 8. Points are earned based on the initial challenge level as long as the initial challenge level was greater than 0. Points are still earned if the challenge level is reduced to 0. Ranks fill from lowest to highest, one point at a time. The number of points per rank should be greater than 1, high enough that earning ranks feels like learning not grinding, and consistent across all ranks.

Consider an action with an initial challenge level of 0; no proficiency point is earned. Consider a character with no ranks toward an action with an initial challenge level of 1 who spends 1 battery point to reduce it to 0; at least 1 proficiency point is earned toward the first rank. Consider the same character with 1 rank toward an action with an initial challenge level of 1 who succeeds on the roll with 2 dice; no proficiency point is earned. Same character, same rank, and an action with an initial challenge level of 2 who succeeeds on the roll with 2 dice; 1 proficiency point is earned.

Characters also have the ability to gain proficiency in using one or more tools. Tools should reduce the challenge level of an action by 1 or more; a character could widdle wood using their fingernails - it would be easier with a knife. Proficiency in a tool should not necessarily be tied to the action performed. This proficiency is indicated as ranks on the tool itself. This separation simulates the separation between general knowledge in a skill and specific knowledge in a tool.

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the Earth, the grave digger should be afforded a slight advantage when braining a zombie with a shovel; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their proficiency in using a blunt weapon increases. The digger may also take a hit to their probabilities if they switch from the shovel to a baseball bat or even more if switching to a gun.

It's recommended that players and narrators determine the pool capacity, subtract 1 for the base die, then split the remaining dice between skill and tool ranks, with skills having more ranks than tools.

## Interacting with other living beings

For non-combat actions, the players can negotiate with the narrator to determine the challenge level of the action against the other living being.

"I want to persuade this person to do this thing." That could result in the narrator saying, "That person didn't require persuasion, they do it." Or, the narrator might say, "This person is a member of a military operations team with training to avoid manipulation, the challenge level is 5 mental" (presuming a mental battery). Then the player spends and rolls as usual.

This way game mechanics can be generated just-in-time instead of restraining players and narrators to a finite list of interaction types.

For combat actions two additional action steps are recommended to maintain consistency and transparency:

1. Calculating the challenge level of the defender.
2. Calculating the number of points drained from the defender's health battery.

Combat action targets the health battery directly. The challenge level determines how hard the target is to hit; therefore, the qualities used should help the defender avoid being hit or make it easier for the attacker to hit the defender. It's recommended that the qualities avoid increasing complexity.

Consider character A (attacker) attacking character B (defender) with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and 1 rank in the longsword specifically. Meanwhile, character A doesn't have any ranks yet. Therefore, character B has more knowledge and experience in that type of attack and weapon and is awarded 1 challenege level for each rank; 2 in this case. Character A spends 2 physical to hit character B. (It's recommended that the challenge level for combat not go above 7 without a narrative point to explain why.)

Now let's calculate the drain on the health battery. In our game the longsword drains 2 points. Character B absorbs all of that potential energy and loses 2 points from their health battery.

Any method can be used so long as it is consistently applied across all living beings, is known, and seems appropriate for the setting and theme.

## Rewarding roleplaying

In roleplaying games, players may slip into metagaming. Metagames usually involve a player using knowledge they have to cause their character to act based on that knowledge, even if the character doesn't have that knowledge.

For example, character A is given a piece of knowledge about a secret room in the inn while away from Character B. Character A returns to character B who starts prodding character A to get that knowledge. Or character B tries a contrived action to accidentally find the secret room.

Instead of trying to punish players for *not* roleplaying, Fourth Earth RAW gives multiple ways for the players and narrator to reward roleplaying as an out-of-character action. Of course, if the rewards are given at no cost, the gameplay could become boring; therefore, it's important everyone agree to the mechanics of this type of reward.

Maybe a claustraphobic character goes splunking in a cave and moves through a narrow passage. The challenge level, due to the phobia, was set to 5. The player acted out the nervousness of the character, didn't spend any physical (or maybe in this case mental) battery points to lower the level. The character made it through. Maybe the narrator rewards the player with battery points or an extra proficiency point. Maybe one of the other players transfers one of their battery points to the character.

So, while there isn't a specific mechanic meant to reward roleplaying by the players, the options are there and players (or the narrator) can tell the player, "This is for the killer roleplaying you just did."

## Conclusion

This base of guidelines should allow you to create a game in any setting with any theme populated by any type of living beings without requiring much in terms of equipment using a simple action mechanic that incorporates tension and strategy.

There are multiple mechanics that have been considered to increase the realism (and complexity) of the simulation with recommendations that keep it minimal and integrated rather than feeling bolted on. They are detailed in the extensions secion.

We also offer guides for various types of play as examples and a different starting point beyond Fourth Earth RAW:

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided).

While they are less of a blank canvas, each successive guide extends the previous.

Thank you for making the time and considering Fourth Earth RAW. All feedback (or contribute) is welcome. The easiest way to give feedback is to leave a [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbruce/fourth-earth-raw) issue and where you can also see upcoming changes.

## References and inspirations

Fourth Earth RAW started from attempting to apply one or more of the following systems to the Fourth Earth setting and theme. There were parts of each system that we appreciated and some we didn't; it happens. We can't give full credit to any one system, we can't say we knew about each of them before making certain decisions, and we can't say we actually know the systems in their entirety. With that said, we can say if you don't like Fourth Earth RAW in its entirety, you might appreciate the following.
