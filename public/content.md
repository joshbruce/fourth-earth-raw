# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling system for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences with the potential for unknown outcomes; it is:

- additive,
- rules-light, and
- action-oriented.

Being additive allows you to build into stories by adding pieces not explicitly spelled out while not starting entirely from scratch; compared to systems providing creatures, settings, worlds, and mechanics. Rules-light means it describes possibilities more than establishing rules. Being action-oriented refers to the primary, generic interaction mechanic; complexity is optional.

The overall system is applicable to:

- solo adventures (1 player of 1 or more characters, with or without a separate narrator), 
- tabletop (more than 1 player, with or without a separate narrator, possibly with the aid of a computer), and 
- computer-aided (computer making computation easier and may act as narrator).

Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting and theme.

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Narrators
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role play over Grinding to become a demigod or metagaming
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge
7. Power ceilings over threat escalation

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and survive or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: There are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players may choose death or continuing with the same character, at a cost.

## Setting

Setting describe where, when, what, theme, and possibly a high-level, central tension. The setting may include a specific, short-term plot (sometimes called an adeventure) or a generic, long-term conceptual view. A theme establishes the type of sentient beings, technologies, and similar.

Settings may be created by a narrator, the players, or a combination of the two. It should be enough to give flavor to the world, not necessarily an in-depth description of all aspects. Examples of settings include:

- Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mostly for combat (a serial war story).
- Greek mythos, specifically The Underworld and the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demogods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
- Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

## Populating the setting

All living beings abide by the same rules and mechanics for action and life consisting of at least:

1. name, allowing for easy identification and differentiation;
2. type, lending a categorization mechanism; and
3. the health battery, which differentiates the being as being alive, subdued, or dead.

Cally the earthworm, for example.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

The health battery simulates the reality that most living things fade over time not in one hit, so to speak. (See "Life batteries" section.)

The first question to ask yourself is: Does your game involve permadeath or not?

Permadeath means death is considered a permanent state and there is no way to recover. For a player whose character has die to continue playing, they will need a new character. Permadeath can feel realistic and can be frustrating as the death of a character may feel like the result of a random roll of dice: We could have done something more to save them. 

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated on a resolution to this question; just offers some thoughts on various scenarios.

Generally, regardless of setting, there should be a way for the health battery to lose and recharge points. If using the passage of time, characters may starve to death or gradually reclaim points. If using items or magic, characters may take damage from outside forces or reclaim points in chunks.

Resurrection may follow the health battery being at 0 for a period of time during which an external force causes the battery to return to 1 or more. In a mundane setting, this may simulate CPR or defibrilator paddles. In a fantasy adventure, it may be magic or healing potions. The premise behind the mechanic is: A character may die, death is not permanent, there will be a penalty in the hopes of instilling caution in the characters. Guidelines for resurrection are:

1. the character should experience a loss (simulating something like physical therapy or lack of oxygen) and
2. the character awakens in the same place they died.

Reincarnation is similar to resurrection only the time from death is sometime longer and the cost is usually higher. Characters may lose all physical possessions, be awakened in an area different than where they died, and not have the same level of proficiency they once did as they learn to navigate a slightly less broken in body.

Consider the following example:

|Type of recovery |Life batteries |Skills |Tool poficiency |Physical goods |
|:----------------|:--------------|:------|:---------------|:--------------|
|Resurrection     |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 1 point |All ranks reduced by 1 point |Still around or recoverable |
|Reincarnation    |All set to 1   |All ranks reduced by 2 points |All ranks reduced by 2 points |No longer available |

More on proficiency points as they relate to ranks in the "Skill and tools" section.

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

The opposing force has qualities used to determine the difficulty of success, which is then attempted by the character through decisions made by the player affecting difficulty, ranks, and other considerations. (See the "Difficulty" section.)

Actions are considered resolved by answering the following questions:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider the following, separate actions: climbing a tree and attacking a rat, respectively.

The tree climb has an initial physical difficulty of 6 (see "Difficulty" secion). The player reduces the difficulty to 4. That reduction came from spending one point from the physical battery; if the player had spent two more points, the difficulty would be 1 - immediate success (see "Life batteries" section). The player decided to only spend one point, however; therefore, a dice pool of one or more dice is rolled (see "Dice pool" section). This character also has one rank in a climbing skill, which adds 1 die to their action pool (see "Skills and tools" section).

If the character succeeds in climbing the tree, they end up in the tree; if they fail, they stay on the ground. In either case, the action is resolved (see "Difficulty" section).

Let's switch to the rat, which has a physical difficulty of 6; everything is the same as the tree climb. If the character succeeds, the rat is hit; if they fail, the rat is missed.

To remain simple, rules-light, and minimize context switching, Fourth Earth RAW strives to use this same mechanism for all interactions characters have with the setting. Details may change, but the flow remains the same: intent, difficulty, adjust, roll if necessary.

### Difficulty

Difficulty describes the opposing force for a given interaction within the setting.

Success is determined by rolling a 1 on at least 1 die in the dice pool. (See "Dice pool" section.)

Difficulty starts with the sides of dice available in a standard set of roleplaying game dice: four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided; with a solution for (or actual use of) a two-sided die. 

There are four ways to refer to the difficulty:

1. sides of dice in the pool,
2. level,
3. success probability, and
4. human-friendly.

When communicating difficulty to a player, it's recommended the sides of dice be used: "Roll d4." 

When adjusting difficulty, it's recommended the level of the difficulty be used. The level is typically the sides of dice divided by 2; difficulty 4 is a level 2 - the exception is [.d20](twenty-sided die), which is level 7: "You reduce the d20 by 1 level, making it a d12 (level 6)." 

Success probability is 1 out of the number of sides on the dice; also represented as 1/10 or 10 percent. 

Human-friendly labels may be used when a character wants to consider, internally, how difficult something might be. Because any player can see this table and translate the human-friendly to a specific level it is recommended that the reply be close but not necessarily exact: A narrator might respod, "That's a safe bet" when the action would actually be "simple," "difficult," or "done." Of course a character may be told the exact difficulty, which may or may not require some type of roll to discover.

|Sides       |Level |Success probability |Human-friendly   |
|:----------:|:----:|:------------------:|:----------------|
| 1          | 0    |1/1                 |Done!            |
| 2          | 1    |1/2                 |Safe bet         |
| 4          | 2    |1/4                 |Simple           |
| 6          | 3    |1/6                 |Difficult        |
| 8          | 4    |1/8                 |Long shot        |
| 10         | 5    |1/10                |Leap of faith    |
| 12         | 6    |1/12                |Improbable       |
| 20         | 7    |1/20                |Inconceivable    |
| No Dice!   | 8    |n/a                 |Impossible, if not lowered |
| n/a        |infinity |0                |Impossible       |

Note: For the purposes of these chapters and sections referencing "difficulty" by itself uses "Sides" while other references will be modified accordingly; "difficulty level," for example.

Two-sided dice may be difficult to find. A coin can be used but may be easier to force. Alternatively, players may use any other die and it's recommended odd numbers be considered 1 (beyond coins, this seems a fair method for replicating a physical, two-sided dice, typically is found as a four-sided die with two 1s and two 2s or plusses and minuses).

When determining difficulty, the recommendation is to consider an average person in the setting and theme (how likely would they be to succeed?). Depending on the setting and to keep characters challenged, a more relative scale might be useful. 

For example, character A is not trained in first aid and decides to attempt stitching a wound in a finger, a physical difficulty of 8 or higher might be realistic. Alternatively, character B is trained in veterinary medicine and might receive a physical difficulty of 4 or 6. Or, in a mundane world, unassisted flight would be infinity, then character A gains the ability to fly, the first attempt might be a difficulty 8 and becomes 0 over time.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall health and vitality.

The maximum value of any life battery is 8.

The only life battery required by Fourth Earth RAW is the health battery. If the battery is reduced to and remains at 0, the character is dead.

Your game may have any number of batteries, with the following considerations:

1. The higher the number of batteries, the harder they are to manage and the tension presented by actions becomes reduced.
2. Use overflow batteries where points from one or more other batteries can be converted to a single point in another battery; cost should be greater than reward, at least 2 points per 1 generated.
3. The health battery should not be available as an overflow.
4. Batteries can be added as gameplay proceeds based on actions taken; running might cause a "physical" battery to be needed, maybe a lot of characters are performing stealth-related skills, prompting the addition of a "stealth" battery.

Consider a system where the cost is the total number of overflow batteries; physical has 2 overflows and health has 3. 

Let's spend 1 point from the physical battery to reduce the difficulty of climbing the tree; notice the character has 0 physical points available to start: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce difficulty) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

To raise the physical battery 1 point means converting 2 battery points pulled on a rotating basis from the other batteries. The target cost is more important than where the points came from; however, distributing the cost evenly is more important than player choice in this instance.

Now consider taking a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1 (maybe the rat hit the character):

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the physical, mental, and spirit batteries (being exhausted is acceptable, being dead typically isn't). It costs 3 battery points to generate 1 point for the health battery.

Further guidelines:

1. Life batteries should recharge somehow; usually multiple ways. 
2. One or more recharging actions should be something the characters can initiate. 

For example, a "mundane game" (as opposed to an "action-adventure" game), might see a character fall from a ladder and have their health battery drained by 3. Maybe they go to sleep and regain 1 for every hour of sleep. Maybe they take some medicine and regain 2 immediately. Maybe they go to the hospital and lose 2 more before regaining all of them. Maybe they do some combination. These are all actions the character can take to recover from the drain on their batteries.

### Dice pools

Dice pools adjust success probability of a difficulty based on based on ranks in skills, tools, and similar modifiers. This means you are free to choose other ways to add to or subtract from the dice pool (see "Skill and tools" section). The dice pool always has at least 1 die; sometimes referred to as "the base die."

Using percentages (instead of fractions) should make this easier to illustrate.

A difficulty 2 has a 50 percent success probability. If, however, there are two dice in the pool, the success probability becomes 75 percent. Or, consider a difficulty 20, which has a 5 percent success probability; 2 dice in the pool makes the success probability just under 10 percent.

It's recommended dice pools do not exceed 5 dice in size.

Over 5 and the pool becomes physically harder to manage or roll and tends to cross the point of diminishing returns.

A difficulty 2 has a 50 percent success probability. 5 dice in the pool makes this roughly 97 percent. To up the percentage to 99.9 requires an additional 5 dice. Put another way, starting from 50 percent a 47 percent increase took 5 dice while a 49.9 increase takes 10. And, with that success probability, it might be easier for the narrator (or player in the role) to make the difficulty 1; automatic success.

Things may seem to change at a higher difficulty level that would make adding more dice reasonable and and can be overcome by adjusting the initial difficulty. For example, a difficulty 20 with 5 dice in the pool has a success probability of roughly 23 percent. If the pool had 10 dice, the success probability would be 40 percent, which is roughly a difficulty 10 with 5 dice in the pool; with a margin less than 1 percent. (This level of fine-grain control may require more crunching, however.)

It is recommended players (and narrators) determine the maximum dice pool size up front, then:

1. subtract 1 for the base die and
2. split the remainder between the number of skill ranks, tool ranks, and any other ways the dice pool might increase.

## Movement

Fourth Earth RAW is not opinionated when it comes to movement beyond creating a desirable experience for those involved. In the type of games most likely to use Fourth Earth RAW, there's a spectrum for space-time and a desire to compress the mundane.

One end of this spectrum is real time simulation; a minute in-game is a minute in-real-life, a mile in-game is a mile in-real-life. We might see the other end as battle simulation and tends to feel more like playing chess; players may take hours to move and may have conversations their characters couldn't in the heat of battle (arguably could be referred to as "metagaming"). 

In the former, the player *is* the character and in the latter the player is more of a storyteller and puppetmaster. The former may be represented as live-action-role-playing and the latter might be represented as a turn-based tabletop roleplaying game with miniatures.

Fourth Earth RAW slants more toward real-time simulation while using dice roll resolution to allow for theater of the mind instead of live-action or miniatures:

1. Make a declaration of what characters are doing.
2. Roll dice pools.
3. Resolve outcomes.

This means time will tend to scale based on what is happening. Long, mundane (low tension) travel over great distances are compressed. Surgical, marvelous interactions (high tension) are inverted. In either case, it can be a good idea to let players know how much in-game time has passed at certain times.

For example, a group of characters decide to walk to a location roughly five hundred kilometers (roughly three hundred miles) away. The average human walks five kilometers per hour (roughly three miles per hour) and can walk roughly ten hours per day; therefore, it will take them roughly ten days to get there. 

As the narrator (or player), unless otherwise agreed to, you might say, "Okay. That's going to take ten days. How often will you make camp? Does anyone want to act anything out during the trip?" and so on. The narrator may decide to roll some dice a few times to see if anything of interest happens along the way; shoes fall apart, a bear wanders into camp on the third day, someone dies of dysentery, or maybe even something positive. In real-time this could take less than one minute but when they arrive, it's still: 10 days later...

Game-time and real-time will most likely invert when the characters go inside wherever it is they've arrived to. Details about the setting are given, explored, considered, discussed. It may take hours of real-time to perform thirty minutes of game-time activities. Let the narrative and character intent drive difficulty. 

A player says their character is going to run the 500 kilometers back to a town and bring help?

This would most likely be an infinity level difficulty; unless there is something in the setting allowing this. For example, let's say the character is super fast, maybe the action (in total) is 4 sub-actions each with a difficulty 20. Or, maybe being super fast is just innate to the setting and the difficulty isn't in reaching the town but in convincing other people to help and travel where they are needed.

Another character in a different setting decides to move behind a target and subdue an oppoenent using a blackjack. Moving behind the target may be a difficulty 10 and subduing with one blow of the blackjack is a difficulty 20; hitting the target alone, without the additional intent, might be a difficulty 4.

## Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW has no predefined list of skills or tools, which allows players to build skill and tool lists as they play in any setting.

When a character attempts something, a skill can be added to their list, and they may gain proficiency points and ranks in that skill. We find this beats having a limited number of skills available from which to choose.

The maximum dice in a dice pool is bound by the maximum number of ranks in total for skills, tools, and any other contributing factors (see "Dice pool" section).

Proficiency points are earned by successfully completing interactions with an initial difficulty level greater than the current rank achieved. Proficiency points are added to the lowest unattained rank first. Because proficiency points are based on the initial difficulty level, reducing the difficulty level to 0 could still result in earning proficiency points. The number of proficiency points per rank should be greater than 1 and be consistent across ranks.

Note: Lower-level ranks will tend to be earned quickly while higher-level ranks will take longer. Partly due to filling up the lower-level ranks first and partly because of possible rarity in higher-level difficulties encountered by characters.

Consider a difficulty 1 (level 0); no proficiency points earned. Consider a difficulty 2 (level 1) and a character with no ranks whose player reduces the difficulty level to 0; 1 proficiency point is earned toward the first rank, which completes the first rank for that character. Consider a difficulty 2 (level 1) and the same character rolling 2 dice now; no proficiency point is earned - the rank is full. Consider a difficulty 6 (level 3) and the same character rolling 2 dice whose player reduces the difficulty to 4 (level 2); one proficiency point is earned toward the second (not third) rank because the second rank isn't full - if it were, then the proficiency point would go toward the thrid rank.

Tools may also have ranks, which can be earned simultaneously with the skill; simulating the difference between general knowledge in a skill and specific knowledge in a tool.

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the Earth, the grave digger should be afforded a slight advantage when braining a zombie with a shovel; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their proficiency in using a blunt weapon increases (see "Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation" section and "Becoming unskilled" extension). The digger may also take a hit to their probabilities if they switch from the shovel to a baseball bat or even more if switching to a gun.

Tools may also decrease the difficulty level of an action; characters could widdle wood with their fingernails but it would be easier with a knife.

## Interacting with other living beings

For non-combat interactions, the players can negotiate with the narrator to determine the difficulty.

"I want to persuade this person to do this thing." The narrator might say, "That person didn't require persuasion (difficulty 1), they do it." Or, the narrator might say, "This person has special training against manipulation, roll mental d10" (presuming a mental battery); the player reduces and rolls as normal.

This way game mechanics can be generated just-in-time instead of constraining players and narrators to a finite list of specific interaction types.

For combat actions two additional steps are recommended to maintain consistency and transparency:

1. Calculating the difficulty in hitting the defender.
2. Calculating the number of points drained from the defender's health battery.

Combat actions target the health battery directly. Difficulty determines how hard the target is to hit; therefore, it's recommended the qualities used would actually help the defender *avoid* being hit or make it *easier* for the attacker to hit. It's also recommended these qualities avoid increasing complexity. Difficulty to hit always starts at 1 (level 0) and is increased from there.

Consider character A attacking character B with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and 1 rank in the longsword specifically. Meanwhile, character A doesn't have any ranks. Therefore, character B has more knowledge and experience in this type of attack and weapon, this knowledge increases the difficulty level of hitting character B by 1: difficulty 2 (level 1).

Let's take the same scenario and give character B two allies who must also be considered while character A attacks. This might increase the difficulty level by 1 again: difficulty 4 (level 2).

Character A manages to hit character B. In the game we developed, longswords drain 2 points per hit. We aren't accouting for resistance, character B has 2 points drained from their health battery.

Some guidelines are:

1. Difficulty doesn't go above 20 (level 7). 
2. The method used is consistently applied, known to the player(s), and appropriate to the setting.

Without these, particularly the second, it may feel like the physics of the setting are loose or the narrator is changing the rules to suit some other purpose, which tends to hinder the enjoyment of the player(s).

## Rewarding roleplaying

In roleplaying games, players may slip into metagaming. Metagames usually involve a player using knowledge they have to cause their character to act based on that knowledge, even if the character doesn't have that knowledge.

For example, character A is given a piece of knowledge about a secret room in the inn while away from Character B. Character A returns to character B who starts prodding character A to get that knowledge transferred to character B. Or character B tries a contrived action to accidentally find the secret room.

Instead of trying to punish players for *not* roleplaying, Fourth Earth RAW gives multiple ways for the players and narrator to reward roleplaying as an out-of-character action. Of course, if the rewards are given at no cost, the gameplay could become boring; therefore, it's important everyone agree to the mechanics of this type of reward.

Maybe a claustraphobic character goes splunking and moves through a narrow passage. Due to the phobia, it's a difficulty 10. The player acted out the anxiety, didn't spend any physical (or maybe in this case mental) battery points to reduce it. The character made it through the passage. Maybe the narrator rewards the player with battery points or an extra proficiency point to the skill. Maybe one of the other players transfers one of their battery points to the character.

So, while there isn't a specific mechanic meant to reward roleplaying by the players (or trading who owns the narration), the basic infrastructure exists to say, "This is for the killer roleplaying you just did, thanks for making this fun."

## Conclusion

Fourth Earth RAW aims to allow you to easily create settings, populate those settings, and allow for sentient sentient characters played by players to interact with and grow within the setting while incorporating strategic play.

Fourth Earth RAW has many extensions that help increase realism or solve specific player concerns. They are detailed in the "Extensions" chapter. The "Extensios" chapter only describes the extensions without defining a required implementation and may have examples of how to implement the extension in a way consistent with the values and principles of Fourth Earth RAW.

Specific implementations of most of the extensions can be found in the other detailed Fourth Earth RAW chapters (expansions):

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided).

The expansions are less of a "blank canvas," each successive expansion building on the previous, and each looks to address problems and take advantage of more specific types of gameplay.

Thank you for making the time and considering Fourth Earth RAW. All feedback (and contributions) welcome. The easiest way to give feedback is to leave a [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbruce/fourth-earth-raw) issue and is where you can also see upcoming changes.

## References and inspirations

Fourth Earth RAW started from attempting to apply one or more of the following systems to the Fourth Earth setting. We appreciated parts and didn't appreciate parts; it happens. 

We can't give full credit to any one system, we can't say awareness of the system was known before implementation in Fourth Earth RAW, and we can't say we know the systems in their entirety. We *can* say, if you don't like Fourth Earth RAW in its entirety, you might appreciate the following.
