# Fourth Earth RAW

Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a cooperative storytelling system for creating “choose your own adventure” experiences and can be used as a foundation for creating other game systems. 

Fourth Earth RAW specifically refers to the core guidelines and implementations described in this chapter and more generally includes the additions and specifications captured in other chapters. 

Fourth Earth RAW is applicable to:

- solo adventures (1 player of 1 or more characters, with or without a separate narrator), 
- tabletop (more than 1 player, with or without a separate narrator, possibly with the aid of digital devices), and 
- digital-assist (1 or more players favoring digital solutions to facilitate gameplay).

This chapter is Fourth Earth RAW at its most raw, so to speak.

**Required equipment:**

1. A way to track the current value of 1 or more life batteries.
2. A way to track proficiency points for ranks and the ranks themselves.
3. A way to randomly select 1 or more distinguishable items from up 12 otherwise indistinguishable items: dice, random number generators, straws of different lengths, 1 suit from a deck of playing cards with the king removed and drawing the ace is equivalent to rolling a 1, whatever is handy.

While dice are not specifically required, Fourth Earth RAW uses the language of dice for common reference.

**Values:**

1. Additive over Reductive: afford players opportunities to add complexity as opposed to filtering to simplicity.
2. Narrative over Simulation: favor creating stories not simulating every aspect of a reality.
3. Flow over Grinding: minimize activities that break the flow of action and storytelling (don’t roll for every step taken).
4. Power ceilings over Threat escalation: causing a 1 point reduction from something with 10 points is the same as reducing 10 points from something with 100 points.
5. Progressive disclosure over Detail saturation: players should be able to start playing having never read the rules and specifications; learning them as they play.

**Principles:**

1. Characters developed by players are played with more care than those arrived at by the system.
2. Grinding to “level up” before joining friends, being jumped up levels without practice, or being the fifth, low-level wheel holding your friends back hinders enjoyment.
3. Narrators aren’t the enemy and is a label capturing responsibilities more than a role given to an individual.
4. Requiring specialty equipment hinders playability and accessibility. 

**Terms:**

The following terms are common to the [.RPG](role playing game) community. The terms are listed with how they are meant in Fourth Earth RAW, which may be the common definition.

- Player: A person playing 1 or more characters and executing game mechanics such as rolling dice and reducing difficulties. 
- Character: Anything that can intentionally interact with and impact the setting and other characters as determined by players using game mechanics.
- Narrator: One or more players who facilitate the story by purposefully impeding forward progress in unforeseen and enjoyable ways; tension and release.
- Non-player character: A character existing outside of those created and played by the main group of players; often played by the narrator(s).
- Opposing character: Often a non-player character acting in opposition to the characters of the main group of players.
- Guideline: One or more suggestions on developing an implementation.
- Implementation: A specific method for executing a game mechanic. 
- Game mechanic: The mechanisms used by players to interact with characters and the game as well as how the game might respond to players and characters. 
- Metagaming: Using information the player has to affect decisions made by the character without the character first acquiring that information.
- Railroading: Players often feel they aren’t given a choice, their choices don’t affect the path of the story and setting, or choices offered tend to be singular or false dichotomies.
- Role playing: 
	- Making decisions the player would make in similar circumstances as the character. 
	- Making decisions an idealized version of the player would make in similar circumstances as the character.
	- Making decisions the player would *not* make because it’s a decision the character would make given the circumstances.

## Setting

Settings describe where, when, what, the theme, and possibly a high-level, central tension the characters exist within. The setting may include a specific, short-term plot (sometimes called an adventure or quest); a generic, long-term campaign; be open for exploration with no predetermined story; or, a combination. A theme establishes the type of character, technologies, and similar.

Guidelines:

1. Settings may come from the player(s), the narrator, the outside world (books, movies, purchased campaigns or adventures), or a combination.
2. There must be enough to give flavor and establish preliminary player expectations; the rest can be built as play proceeds. 

Examples of settings include:

- Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, hospital camp, filled with ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mainly for healing (a serial war story).
- Greek mythos, specifically The Underworld during the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demigods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
- Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

## Characters

Characters include anything in the setting that can be personified by the player(s).

Implementation:

1. Must include a name that easily distinguishes one character from another.
2. Must have 1 or more life batteries (see “Life batteries” section).
3. Should include at least 1 broader classification to group the character with characters of a similar type (female, elderly, elf).
4. Should favor nurture over nature regarding learnable qualities.
5. Should be played by the same player with every appearance; unless players have previously agreed on alternatives (see "Player pacts" section).

Consider:

Cally the earthworm, for example.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW character is created.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall life force and store battery points. 

Guidelines:

1. Each battery should have the same number of maximum battery points.
2. When all (or one) life battery is reduced to and remains 0, the character should be considered dead.
3. Keep the number of life batteries minimal as each life battery increases administrative overhead and tends to reduce tension in action performance.
4. Life batteries should recharge; usually in multiple ways. 
5. One or more ways to recharge should be something players can initiate: “I would like to rest.”
6. Favor “both way” solutions: If the battery can recharge over time, there should be a way for the battery to drain over time (starvation or poison, for example).
7. Batteries can be added as you play; maybe a lot of characters are performing stealth-related actions prompting the creation of a "stealth" battery.

Implementation:

1. Spending battery points can reduce the difficulty level when interacting with the setting.
2. All characters should start with the same (or very similar) set of batteries with the same rules governing their operation. 

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force.

Implementation: 

Action resolution has at least the following phases: 

1. character intent, 
2. assigned difficulty using qualities of  the opposing force (see “Difficulty” section), 
3. opportunity for the player to reduce difficulty, and 
4. player roll, if applicable.

Actions are considered resolved when at least the following questions are answered:

- Did the character succeed?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider:

Character A wants to climb a tree with a difficulty 3 (see "Difficulty" section). 

If the player spends 3 life battery points, the difficulty would become 0; immediate success (see "Life batteries" section). However, the player only spends 1 making the difficulty 2.

Because the difficulty is greater than 0 after reduction, a dice pool is rolled. There is always 1 die available (see "Dice pool" section). Character A has 1 rank in climbing, which adds another die to the pool (see "Ranks" section). The player rolls [.2d4](two four-sided dice).

If the character succeeds in climbing the tree, they end up in the tree; if they fail, they stay on the ground (see "Difficulty" section). Either way, the action is resolved. 

How about attacking a rat? The calculated difficulty for hitting the rat is 3; everything is the same as the tree climb. 

If the character succeeds, the rat is hit; if they fail, the rat is missed.

To remain simple, rules-light, and minimize context switching, Fourth Earth RAW strives to use this same mechanic for all opposed interactions characters have with the setting and other characters.

### Difficulty

Difficulty is based on qualities of the opposing force for a given interaction.

Implementation:

1. Success is achieved by rolling a 1 on at least 1 die in the dice pool (see "Dice pool" section).
2. Difficulty levels range from 0 to infinity; where 0 is an automatic success and infinity is strictly impossible.
3. Difficulty levels have an inner range of 1 through 7; doubling the level number results in the sides of dice in the pool (or the upper limit of the range).
4. Players should be able to create groups of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 similar items and randomly select at least 1 unique item. 
5. Difficulty 7 is impossible unless reduced as it has no associated standard die. 

There are four standard ways to refer to difficulty:

1. level (most common), 
2. opposing level,
3. sides of dice (upper limit),
4. base success probability, and
5. human-friendly label.

| Level | Opposing level | Sides | Base success probability | Human-friendly |
|:--:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| 0 | Infinity | 0 | 1/1 | Done! |
| 1 | 7 | 2 | 1/2 | Safe bet |
| 2 | 6 | 4 | 1/4 | Simple |
| 3 | 5 | 6 | 1/6 | Difficulty |
| 4 | 4 | 8 | 1/8 | Long shot |
| 5 | 3 | 10 | 1/10 | Leap of faith |
| 6 | 2 | 12 | 1/12 | Inconceivable |
| 7 | 1 | No dice! | n/a | Impossible, if not lowered |
| Infinity | 0 | n/a | 0 | Impossible |

Further guidelines:

1. Favor setting difficulty based on an average character in the setting with the option of being character-specific: stitching a finger might be difficulty 6 for the average person but a difficulty 2 for someone with related training (see “Dice pools” section).
2. For difficulty 1, favor dice over coins and a roll of odd numbers over even; maintains rolling 1 as target or recognizing odd numbers as opposed to dividing, remembering ranges, or similar solutions.
3. Human-friendly labels are typically used during character introspection, "This seems like a safe bet"; to add tension and simulate under- or over-estimating one's abilities, it might be useful to give a label near the difficulty rather than exactly on it.

### Dice pools

Dice pools adjust success probability based on ranks (see “Ranks” section). 

“Dice pool” is something of a misnomer as rolling the number of dice in the pool is not necessary; roll the same die (pick from the same grouping) equal to the number of dice in the pool.

Implementation:

1. The dice pool always starts with 1 die; sometimes referred to as the base die.
2. Ranks are the primary way to increase the number of dice in the pool: “I get 1 more for a rank in climbing, another because I’m using a grappling hook, and an additional die because my friends are cheering me on.”

Consider:

Difficulty 1 has a 50 percent (1/2) base success probability; with 2 dice in the pool, the actual success probability is 75 percent.

Difficulty 6 has roughly an 8 percent base success probability; with 2 dice, it's roughly 16 percent.

Guidelines:

1. When customizing the system￼, player(s) and the narrator(s) should determine a maximum dice pool, subtract 1 for the base die, and split the rest to create ranks. 
2. Dice pools should not exceed 5 dice to: 
	- allow space for non-action dice, 
	- keep the pool more physically manageable, and
	- account for diminishing returns for pools of more than 5. 

Consider:

Difficulty 1, base success probability of 50 percent.

5 dice in the pool changes the success probability to roughly 97 percent. A success probability of 99.9 percent requires an additional 5 dice in the pool (10 in total). 

Put another way, doubling the dice in the pool is an increase of 2.9 percent (compared to 47 percent with the first 5). It may be more beneficial to lower the difficulty to 0.

## Interacting with characters

Role playing interactions with other characters is left to the players, this section discusses interactions where dice may resolve an outcome or an intent is opposed by another character. 

Guidelines:

1. Difficulty is derived from qualities of the opposing character; if the target character chooses not to oppose whatever the other character is attempting, the difficulty is 0. 
2. Whatever implementation is used, apply modifiers with the greatest impact first; if difficulty reaches 7, it should remain 7 and no further considerations be made (or it is impossible, which might feel like railroading, beware).
3. Implementations should adjust difficulty level not another quality of difficulty.

Consider:

Player A wants character A to persuade character B to do something.

In one scenario, player B, who is playing character B says, “I’m okay with that.” Difficulty becomes 0, no calculations or rolls necessary. 

In another scenario, player A is playing character A and the narrator is playing character B, both of whom are international spies. 

Character A is tied to a chair and badly beaten. Character A is attempting to persuade character B to let them go. Character B is specially trained against manipulation. With this training and having a severe advantage, the difficulty for the persuasion is 7 (if not infinity).

Implementation (combat):

1. Difficulty refers specifically to difficulty to hit; therefore, qualities used to calculate difficulty should help the defender evade (not block or absorb).

Consider:

Character A attacking character B with a longsword. Character B has 1 rank in two-handed weapons and another in longsword specifically. The implementation being used makes hitting character B a difficulty 2 (1 per rank).

Let’s give character B two allies, which character A must consider while trying to hit character B. This might increase the difficulty 1; now 3.

Character A manages to hit character B. In the game we developed, longswords drain 2 points per hit; character B has 2 points drained from 1 of their life batteries.

## Ranks

Ranks serve two primary purposes:

1. represent character improvement (progression) through intentional action and
2. offer an alternative means of increasing success probability.

Implementation:

1. Ranks are made of 2 or more proficiency points.
2. Proficiency points are earned by successfully overcoming difficulties with an initial level greater than the current rank achieved. 
3. Characters may still receive proficiency points when reducing a difficulty to 0. 
4. Proficiency points are added to the lowest unattained rank first. 

Consider:

Character A successfully completes a difficulty 0 action; no proficiency points are earned. 

Character A has no ranks and is attempting a difficulty 1 action. Player A (who’s playing character A) reduces the difficulty to 0. 1 proficiency point is earned toward the first rank, which completes that rank for character A. 

Character A now has 1 rank and tries another difficulty 1 action. Player A would roll 2 dice and character A earns 0 proficiency points; the rank of the corresponding difficulty is full. 

Character A is attempting a difficulty 3 action. Character A has 1 rank, which means player A rolls 2 dice. 1 proficiency point is earned toward the second, unfilled rank; not the third.

Note: Lower-level ranks tend to be earned quickly and higher ranks are earned slower due in part to lower ranks filling first and from scarcity of higher level difficulties. 

Guidelines:

1. The number of proficiency points per rank should be consistent across all types of ranks.
2. Ranks should be earned at least by using skills associated with actions.
3. 1 successful action may result in proficiency points being earned on multiple rank-able aspects of the character. 

## Time and space

How are real-time and game-time related? Is there a strict calendar?

How much space can a character cover in a given amount of time in a given circumstance? 

Do characters age? Does that aging occur even when the character is not being actively played? Can a character die while the player is away?

Guidelines:

1. Compress what players consider the mundane and expand what they consider the marvelous.
2. Favor cinematic over real-time.
3. Favor real-time over turn-based.
4. Be fluid based on narrative.

Consider: 

Character A just arrived at the gates of a fairly safe and mundane town. Character A wants to go to the inn 1 kilometer away. Of the following implementations, tend toward the first:

1. There’s a 10 percent chance something interesting will happen in that distance over time. [.1d10](one ten-sided die) is rolled, nothing interesting happens and character A arrives at the inn without incident. The walk took less than 1 minute real-time and roughly 15 minutes game-time.
2. 1 kilometer will be roughly 1,200 steps. Each step will be given a difficulty based on terrain, distractions caused by the surroundings (the smell of pastries), and crowd density. The players wait as difficulty calculations are made for all 1,200 steps, if difficulty is 1 or higher, players reduce difficulties and roll dice, followed by narration of outcomes along with detailed descriptions of every shopfront. This could take 1 hour real-time and cover the same 15 minutes game-time.

Both versions track the character from the gates to the inn with the possibility of something interesting happening between here and there. Both also *feel* very different from the player perspective. 

In the first, the journey as a whole was given a probability for something interesting to happen (good or bad). In the second, each step was given a difficulty (most were 0 and all were probably less than 5, depending on how good the pastries smelled that day). If the character were encumbered somehow, inebriated or carrying a load, the second implementation might feel less like “rolling for simulation sake.”

Now, character A is at the pub when a fight breaks out; they are not part of, nor do they want to take part in, the fight. Character A decides to walk from the bar to the exit door. 

Under mundane circumstances real-time and game-time would almost be in sync; however, in a brawl it might take character A 2 or 3 turns as they avoid being pulled into the fight and watch for flying objects.

Having made it to the doors, character A realizes they forgot their hat at the bar. The fight is dying down and a path is clear between the doors and the part of the bar where the hat was. 

Unfortunately character B appears to have claimed the hat as their own. A look from character B indicates character A isn't getting it back without a fight. Character A decides to walk over, throat-punch the stranger, take the hat, and walk out. 

We decide character A can overcome 1 difficulty 6 action to execute the entire plan (fairly mundane); or, it will take 1 turn to get there, another to punch character B (a difficulty 3 action), and a third turn to be back at the door.

At the height of the brawl, it took 3 turns just to walk out.

Guidelines (decomposition):

Tools decay. Skills are forgotten without use or practice. Characters age. Even mountains erode.

1. Favor gradual over drastic decomposition: human-made buildings will fall but rarely all at once without intent or a chain of events starting from an initial failure. 
2. There should be maintenance actions characters can take (or points players can earn and spend) to reduce any applied rate of decomposition: changing fluids for a combustion motor.
3. Establish life expectancies at the moment of creation.

Consider:

Character A has 1 rank in a skill with 2 more proficiency points in the same skill. Character A hasn’t used that skill in a while and is asked to remove 1 proficiency point. 

## Player pacts

To use the parlance of our time, player pacts are the terms of service for the game.

Just like Fourth Earth RAW describes the physics for interacting with the setting, player pacts describe the physics for collaboration and communication across players; establishing social norms and mores to set baseline expectations, boundaries, and accommodate player needs.

While these don’t need to be formally written and signed like legal contracts, players may find it useful to write them down for easy reference and modification later. Groups of players who are close friends or have played together for years with established, rarely forgotten norms and mores could be an exception; until a new player arrives. 

Guidelines:

1. Any list of written pacts should be short; possibly limited to those things that are most often forgotten or are considered dealbreakers.
2. New group members should be informed of at least the dealbreaker pacts up front; if time allows, it may be worth introducing the new player to all the pacts. 

Consider:

Reference preference: How should people be referred (character name, legal name, either based on content and context, pronouns)? 

Session schedule: When can I arrive? When does play begin? When does play end? When do I need to leave? How long is the play session? Will there be breaks? How rigid or fluid is time kept? 

Gaming schedule: Is this a one-shot (1 session, less than 2 hours), adventure (1 or 2 sessions, 4 to 6 hours), or campaign (3 or more sessions, 12 or more hours)? How likely are characters to die (should 1 or 2 backup characters be prepared)? Is this more about gathering with friends regularly or about playing the game regularly? How often do we meet and when? What if I can’t make it (character in safety bubble, played by fallback player, session rescheduled)?

Preparedness: What are players expected to bring? What should be provided by the host? Do players have specific needs (standing up to think, visual impairments, first aid and medical needs)?

“Table” etiquette: Is eating and drinking at the table okay? What tools are allowed (digital devices to roll dice)? What non-game distractions are permitted (social media)? What’s the tone of the table (idle chitchat with the game as a secondary activity, or vice versa)?

Gameplay: Is it in-person, virtual, hybrid? Are sessions recorded, streamed, published? Theater of the mind, miniatures, live-action, hybrid? Silly, serious, somewhere in-between? What are your thoughts and considerations around metagaming and railroading? Are there subjects that should be avoided in the game content?

Changed: How do pacts get changed? How often can pacts change? How is inter-player conflict handled? What happens when players leave? What happens when players join?

Addressing these questions up front can help smooth out a potentially bumpy road of “politely” going along to get along until someone stops being polite and starts getting real about how annoying the sound of popping gum and clicking pens is to them. 

## Conclusion

Fourth Earth RAW aims to allow you to focus on setting and characters rather than game mechanics while affording players the opportunity to strategically interact with the setting through their character(s) who, in turn, grow within the setting.

Fourth Earth RAW has multiple additions to increase realism or resolve specific concerns. Various guidelines, not implementations, are in the "Fourth Earth RAW: Additions" chapter.

Specifications wrap the core Fourth Earth RAW system and offer specific implementations for various additions tailored to specific contexts. Specifications include:

1. Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), 
2. Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and 
3. Fourth Earth [.DA](digital assisted).

Each successive specification wraps the previous.

Fourth Earth DA describes using digital tools to aid both tabletop and video game play.
