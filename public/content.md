# Fourth Earth RAW

The Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) is a game system which should allow for computer-aided, tabletop (pen and paper), and solo gameplay. It can be considered a rules-light, action-based system. It is rules-light insofar as the "rules" described here are more like minimal guidelines used to create characters and have those characters interact with the world and each other. Fourth Earth RAW is like describing the physics within a setting, theme, and campaign.

The core values driving the system are:

1. Players over Game Masters
2. Narrative over Mechanics
3. Flow over Crunching
4. Role play over Grinding to be a demigod
5. Skill and proficiency over level and age
6. Progressive disclosure over rewarding lore or system knowledge

The core principles:

1. Favor player success: Anyone can start at anytime and hold their own or join others. Anyone can do just about anything, once. Anyone can improve skills and proficiencies.
2. The player defines the role: there are no innate bonuses or penalties resulting from character creation and there is no history of separatism and isolation from other species.
3. Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation: Players should be allowed to choose death or continuing with the same character, at a cost.

## Populating the setting

All living beings abide by the same rules of creation and action.

Choose a name appropriate to the setting and theme, which can be used to easily identify the living being.

Choose the type of living being this represents: creature, player character, non-player character.

Have a way to track a life battery representing health with a maximum of 10 points. If the health battery reaches and stays at 0, the lifeform is considered dead.

Add a way to track any other life batteries for the game being played.

At this point, a basic Fourth Earth RAW life form is created.

## Interacting with the setting

Every action starts with an intent and an opposing force. For an action to be considered resolved, we must answer all of the following questions:

- Did the character succeed?
- If applicable, was that success (or failure) critical in nature?
- How was the outside world affected?

Consider a non-combat and combat action: climbing a tree and attacking a rat, respectively.

The tree climb starts as a challenge level of 3; roughly a 17 percent chance of success. The player chooses to reduce the challenge level by spending 1 point from an associated battery (1 level per point drained); making the challenge level 2, a 25 percent chance of success. If the challenge level is reduced to 0, the climb is successful (with no opportunity of criticality); otherwise, a dice pool of 1 or more dice is rolled.

There is always at least 1 die in the pool. The number of dice can be increased by achieving ranks in skills; 1 extra die per rank. This character has 1 rank in climbing, which brings the number of dice in the pool to 2; roughly a 43 percent chance of success. To succeed, at least 1 die in the pool should have a value of 1 when rolled; to rephrase, the target to be rolled is at least one 1.

Upon failure or success, there should be a side-effect that impacts the character or outside world; with or without the criticality extension. In the case of climbing the tree, the character either remains where they were or makes it up the tree on failure or success, respectively.

Let's consider the rat, which has a calculated challenge level of 3 based on various characteristics of the combat and being involved. Everything is the same as the tree climb, and the two should remain at similar levels of complexity to reduce the need for context or mode switching by players. Upon failure or success, the side-effect will be missing the defender or hitting for 1 or more points drained from the defender's health battery.

### Challenge levels

Challenge describe the probability of success for an action. The scale begins with 0 and ends at infinity representing 100 percent chance of success to completely impossible in the world, respectively; standing up might typically be a 0 while drawing a laser sword in a medieval setting would be infinite. The inner range is from 1 through 8 where 8 is impossible without some form of assistance; climbing a potruding ice wall, in the rain and heavy winds, with no tools. Challenge levels 1 through 7 have a decreasing probability of success represented by a standard coing or die:

|Generic name           |Challenge level |Probability of success |Standard die or coin               |
|:----------------------|:--------------:|:---------------------:|----------------------------------:|
|Easy                   | 0              | 100 percent           | n/a                               |
|Safe bet               | 1              | 50                    | [.d2](two-sided die or coin flip) |
|Simple                 | 2              | 25                    | [.d4](four-sided die)             |
|Difficult              | 3              | ~17                   | [.d6](six-sided die)              |
|Long shot              | 4              | ~13                   | [.d8](eight-sided die)            |
|Leap of faith          | 5              | 10                    | [.d10](ten-sided die)             |
|Improbable             | 6              | ~8                    | [.d12](twelve-sided die)          |
|Inconceivable          | 7              | 5                     | [.d20](twenty-sided die)          |
|Impossible, if unaided | 8              | 0                     | n/a                               |
|Impossible             |infinite        | 0                     | n/a                               |

In general, the scale uses an average person in the world and mundane actions; however, to keep things challenging for the characters in the setting and based on the theme, a more relative scale might be beneficial. For example, character A decides they want to attempt stitching a finger, they are not a doctor and have no training, probably a challenge level of 4 or higher. Alternatively, character A who has training in veterinary medicine might receive a challenge level of 2 or 3.

### Life batteries

Life batteries represent a character's overall health and vitality.

The maximum value of any life battery is 10.

The only life battery required by Fourth Earth RAW is the health battery. If the battery is reduced to and remains at 0, the character is dead.

Your game may have as many life batteries as you see fit; however, it is recommended the number of batteries be minimal to make them more manageable. 

To increase the possibility of strategic gameplay and tension while favoring player success, if non-health life batteries are introduced we recommend using an overflow drain mechanic whereby points from other batteries can be used to create a point of another when needed. Typically this conversion should take more enery than is produced; 2 points per 1 generated, for example.

A system that seems to work well is to use the count of overflow batteries. Let's spend 1 point from the physical battery to reduce the challenge level of climbing the tree; notice the character has 0 physical points available: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend (reduce challenge level) |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

To raise the physical battery 1 point means converting 2 battery points pulled on a rotating basis from the other batteries. The target cost is more important than where the points came from; however, distributing the risk evenly is more important than player choice in this instance.

Now consider taking a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1 (maybe the rat hit the character):

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |

The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the physical, mental, and spirit batteries. It cost 1 battery unit per non-health battery to generate 1 point for the health battery.

Life batteries should recharge somehow; usually multiple ways. At least one of these recharging actions should be something the characters can initiate. For example, a "mundane game" (as opposed to an "action-adventure" game), might see a character fall from a ladder and have their health battery drained by 3. Maybe they go to sleep. Maybe they take some medicine. Maybe they go to the hospital. Maybe they do some combination.

### Dice pools

Dice pools further adjust the probability of success for a given action.

A level 1 challenge has a 50 percent probability of success. If the dice pool has 2 dice instead of 1, that probability becomes 75 percent.

Adding dice is done through skill ranks related to a given action, tool, or both. Every successful attempt of an action with a challenge level greater than the current rank adds 1 point toward the next rank.

Consider the character climbing the tree. Let's say they have 1 rank in climbing and their current climb is a challenge level 1. They would roll 2 dice, if necessary, but not earn any points toward the second rank in climbing. If they're next climb is a challenge level 2, then they would.

It's worth noting that they would earn this point even if the challenge level was reduced to 0. Characters earn points for what they accomplished, not how they accomplished it.

Tools also have the ability to rise in rank. This simulates skills being tool agnostic. A carpenter may be very proficient using a hammer but not a nail gun.

It's recommended that the number of ranks not surpass 4; a dice pool of 5. More than this and the dice pool can become unmanageable and crosses the point of diminishing returns. 5 dice in a pool for a level 1 challenge results in a roughly 97 percent chance of success, at which point, for that character, maybe the action is a level 0 not a 1 anymore.

For completeness, 10 dice in the pool would be 99.9 percent chance of success. It twice as many dice to overcome the final 3 percent. Diminishing returns.

### Criticality extension

Fourth Earth RAW separates the probability of success (or failure) and the probability of succeeding (or failing) critically.

If you would like to simulate the idea of a critical success or failure, we recommend adding another die to the pool that can be distinquished from the others in some way. If the value of this die is also a 1 after the roll, the success-fail outcome is considered critical. The criticality result does not change the outcome of the success-fail roll, just the serverity and possible side-effects.

If the success or failure was critical, the player might roll another standard die and use a table to determine what happened; of course, you can use anything really, maybe a card drawn from a deck. It could even become a collaboration between storytellers where the player tells the facilitator what they would like the critical success or failure to look like and the facilitator edits and massages until a worthwhile story arrives.

Again, the guideline here is that criticality does not change the success or failure, just the severity and side-effects.

## Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW seeks to be a generic system that allows for rapid start and evolution; therefore, there is no predefined set of skills and tools. Further, the presumption is that any character can attempt anything, only the probabilities of success are changed. When a character attempts something, capture that as a skill, let them gain ranks in it. We find this beats having a large list of skills and having to choose a subset to become practiced in.

It's recommended that skills be limited to 3 ranks and tools be limited to 1. Ranks increase as described in the Dice pools section.

Tools should reduce the challenge level of an action by 1 or more; a character could widdle wood using their fingernails and it would be easier with a knife. Proficiency in a tool should not necessarily be tied to the action performed. 

For example, a grave digger is probably proficient in using a shovel to dig graves. When the zombie hoards begin roaming the Earth, the grave digger should be afforded a slight advantage when braining a zombie with a shovel; of course, over time, the grave digger's digging proficiency might decrease while their proficiency in using a blunt weapon increases. The digger may also take a hit to their probabilities if they switch from the shovel to a baseball bat or even more if switching to a gun.

### Maintenance, degredation, and loss extension

In life if a skill is not used, it may be forgotten and a tool may be underused and become rusty or overused and needed replacing more often.

For this extension, skills that go unused for a predetermined period of time might be reduced by a rank and tools that are not maintained might randomly break upon use (possibly used in conjunction with the criticality extension). 

Maybe characters are given access to a gym, chemistry, or some other appropriate means to increase or maintain skills when not in odd situations. Maybe there are other tools a character can use to maintain other tools. If characters don't take advanantage, the tools become less useful or unusable over time.

## Combat extras

Involuntary draining of the health battery is classified as a combat action. There is an attacker and defender, the former is trying to drain the health battery and the latter is trying to avoid that drain.

Combat uses the same overall mechanic as any action with two additional steps:

1. Calculating the challenge level of the defender.
2. Calculating the number of points drained from the defender's health battery.

The challenge level is only used to determine whether the attackers hits the defender; therefore, for the sake of continuity, the qualities taken into consideration should help the defender avoid being hit.

Consider a fight between two characters. The attacker is using a longsword. The defender has a rank in two-handed weapons and one in the longsword. It's likely this knowledge would help them avoid being hit by a longsword and maybe increases their challenge level by the total number of ranks; 2 in this case.

Same fight. Generally speaking larger targets are easier to hit than smaller targets. Let's say the defender here is smaller than the attacker and we decide that adds another challenge level. Now the defender is a challenge level 3.

When calcultating combat challenge level we recommend that the challenge level not go above 7. It's also recommended that the steps to arrive at the challenge level be minimal to avoid slowing down the action doing math.

Let's say the attacker has hit the defender. Now, we need to calculate potential energy, how many points could get drained from the defender.

Any method can be used so long as it is consistently applied across all living beings, is known, and seems appropriate for the setting and theme.

Let's say the attacker had a potential energy of 3, if the defender absorbs that, their health battery is drained by 3 points.

### Resistance extension

Resistance is the amount a defender can reduce the potential energy of an attacker based on their qualities and characteristics.

The resistance amount could be flat, roll-based, something else, or some combination. The goal is to have a means to perform the calculation quickly to avoid slowing down the action to do math.

Maybe a superhero has a full drop again blunt weapons used by normal citizens (invincibility). Maybe they initial drop that amount but immediately bounce back a percentage of the drop (rapid healing). 

Just like the other methods and calculations resistance should be consistantly applied, known by (or accessible to) all, and appropriate to the setting and theme.

### Subdue or kill extension

It may be worthwhile to openly discuss and decide what happens when a defender's health battery hits and remains at 0.

Fourth Earth RAW does not take a moral stance, leaving it to the setting, theme, and story of others. With that said, you may have a setting in which killing other life form is frowned upon and the people and culture prefers to subdue and arrest.

If you opt for a subdue by default approach, when the defender's battery hits 0, maybe it immediately jumps back to 1 and the attacker needs to consciously choose to kill the defender. The ramifications of killing, not killing, and not restraining is left to the storytellers.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you're able to get a feel for the gameplay, mechanics, and constraints of Fourth Earth RAW. We hope you find it challenging, fun, and flexible where you need it to be. 

If you would like to see a full example of these rules expanded and used as the game physics of a setting and theme, check out Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures), Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop), and Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided), which are a little less of a blank canvas and usable in your own stories.
