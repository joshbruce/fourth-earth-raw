# Fourth Earth CA

Fourth Earth [.CA](computer-aided) is an expansion of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop) intended for multiplayer gameplay with the aid of computer. There are two primary areas of application for Fourth Earth CA:

1. computer-aided solo or tabletop play in any setting or theme and
2. the Fourth Earth [.MORPG](multiplayer online role playing game).

For the first we offer character sheets, dice towers, and so on for you and others to play in your own settings and themes. One participant must be designated as the narrator; however, they may be playing a character as well. (All participants must have a 4th.earth account.)

For the second we offer a text-based experience in the setting and theme described by Fourth Earth Lore. There are differences and similarities between the two, which are described here.

4th.earth subscriber can choose to only subscribe to access tabletop-related game play or, as a player account holder, have access to both.

## Creating the setting

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

As a tabletop subscriber, you are able to create descriptions for multiple settings to invite others to.

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

We want as many people as possible to experience the joy available from this type of gameplay; therefore, only one person needs to be subscribed to 4th.earth to create a world and invite players to it. The others players only need 4th.earth accounts.

You invite them, they sign in, join your game, and you play. Every player is given access to their character sheet.

The world you create is stored with you and their characters are stored with them.

### Difficulty

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, the designated narrator (the one who started the game) defines difficulty and assigns them to players (with associated target battery). The players can then do what they want to do to try and accomplish what they were trying to accomplish.

### Life batteries

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In both editions, life batteries are managed automatically. 

### Dice pools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In both editions, the type and number of dice in the pool are managed, and rolled, automatically. (Technical note: We use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to similate rolling the dice.)

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, if your world doesn't have magic, disabling this extension is not necessary; you can use the spirit battery for something else or not at all.
