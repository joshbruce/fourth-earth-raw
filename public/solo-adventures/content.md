# Fourth Earth SA

Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures) is an expansion of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) intended for solo play in a tabletop or pen-and-paper fashion. Fourth Earth SA presumes a single player who is playing one or more characters in the setting. 

Arguably the main hurdle for solo play is coming up with a world in which the player can be surprised by what is found and what must be done. One solution to this problem is to have a narrator who has the knowledge of the world and provides the story. Another solution is to use a deck of cards (or a deck designed for solo roleplaying) or something similar to alter the building of the setting, theme, and world.

Fourth Earth SA also presumes as little equipment as possible. You will want a way to:

- track life batteries,
- track skill ranks,
- track tool ranks, and
- generate random numbers between 1 and 20.

Generating random numbers can use an online dice roller, there are plenty avaialable, or using a standard, physical set of 7 RPG dice. If what you find doesn't have the ability to create pools, or you only have one set of dice, no worries, you can roll the same die repeatedly to represent the pool (stopping as soon as you hit a 1).

## Creating the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

The setting and theme may use Fourth Earth Lore; not required.

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA uses 4 life batteries: health, physical, mental, and spirit.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

|Type |Effect |
|:----|:------|
|Death         | -1 point to all acquired ranks (no change to partials) |
|Reincarnation | -1 point to all ranks (acquire and partial); loss of physical assets; character awakes in hometown, roughly as if character created anew |
|Resurrection  | 1 to health battery (others are at 0) |

Since proficiency points are taken at death and reincarnation ranks, specifically lower level ranks, will have been reduced by 2 points. Proficiency points are taken at death even if character is immediately resurrected.

### Offspring extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

See Fourth Earth Lore specifically on how reproduction works in that setting.

In general, Fourth Earth SA says a character can only be played by one player. This tends to keep a character's decisions consistent and minimizes the risk of what happens if the player is not available and someone elese plays that character; given Fourth Earth SA is geared toward solo adventures, one player per character should not be difficult.

For Fourth Earth SA, we tend to favor using the currency of the setting to simulate time and money spent caring for the child. A flat cost may not simulate reality and might make it impossible for some to reproduce; if that's part of your setting, that's okay. A percentage of current monetary assets (and possibly physical assets) may be interesting as well as it might simulate the child who starts working young help pay bills. Or, it could be a bit of both.

As long as it's consistently applied, the players are aware of how it works, and it's appropriate to the setting and theme.

## Interacting with the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Difficulty

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Life batteries

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

There are **four life batteries**:

|Name     |Convertible from             |Cost to increase 1 point |
|:--------|:----------------------------|:---------------:|
|Health   |physical, mental, and spirit | 3 |
|Physical |mental and spirit            | 2 |
|Mental   |physical and spirit          | 2 |
|Spirit   |physical and mental          | 2 |

The health battery always tracks injuries. Actions have an associated target battery, which means each battery tends to have a primary action category:

|Name     |Action category                             |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------------|
|Health   |Injury and healing                          |
|Physical |Physically dominant actions                 |
|Mental   |Mentallly or psychologically taxing actions |
|Spirit   |Magic- or spirituality-related actions      |

The primary recharging actions are as follows and do not represent all the ways of recharging batteries: 

|Action        |Time to recharge |Target battery |Target battery increase per time unit |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-------------:|
|Rest          |Slow             |Health         | 2 |
|Nap           |Fast             |Physical       | 3 |
|Sleep         |Fastest          |Physical       | 4 |
|Meditate      |Fast             |Mental         | 3 |
|Revere (pray) |Fast             |Spirit         | 3 |

For each unit of time all batteries are recharged at least 1 point. The target battery is charged by the amount in the table above.

Because these are actions that can be given a difficulty, whatever happens on success and failure is whatever makes sense to the setting, theme, and players. 

For example, our characters are in an airplane. They decide to go to sleep. It's loud and one of our characters is afraid of flying, for them it might be a difficulty 10 or 12. Somehow they manage to sleep that first round; everyone gets the recharge for the first unit of time. They roll for the second unit; our friend who's afraid to fly fails. The same player fails the next one. All players fail the next one, which is good because the plane is going down. 

The character who's afraid to fly only got 1 round of recharge while everyone else got 3. The number of rolls and how much is replenished is entirely up to you and your players; it could be a completely safe place during a mundane period and the characters say, "We want to sleep" to which the narrator replies, "Cool. Everyone's batteries are full."

### Dice pools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Criticality extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Criticality is determined by rolling a 1 on [.1d10](one 10-sided die) following or in conjunction with rolling the action dice pool.

**If the success was critical on a non-combat action**, a side effect is randomly selected from the following table using the roll of [.1d12](one twelve-sided die):

|Result |Effect  |Narrative |
|:------|:-------|:---------|
|Even number |+1 |Elation from success! |
|1, 5, 9     |+2 |same                  |
|3, 7        |+3 |same                  |
|11          |+5 |same                  |

These points are applied to the target battery of the action (climbing a tree would be physical and magic would be spirit). If that battery is or becomes full, the remaining points can be distributed as the player sees fit; including the health battery.

**If the failure was critical on a non-combat action**, do the same as a non-combat critical success only using negative numbers instead of positive.

**If the success was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect           |
|:------|:----------------|
|Even number |+1 to the battery used by the attacker or any other battery, if full |
|1, 5, 9     |base potential energy times 1.5 |
|3, 7        |base potential energy times 2   |
|11          |trauma (see next table) |

If the follow-up roll was an 11 (an exploding die), roll another 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result    |Effect  |
|:-------|:-------|
|1       |difficulty of defender reduced 2 levels, recurring and compounding |
|2, 5, 8 |-1 from defender's physical battery                     |
|3, 6, 9 |-1 from defender's mental battery                       |
|4, 7    |-1 from defender's spirit battery                       |
|10      |-1 from defender's health battery, recurring and compounding |
|11      |base potential energy times 3 targeting the defender    |
|12      |defender is unable to act for 2 rounds                  |

Recurring means the effect will occur every round until fixed. Compounding means if the same effect happens again, the effect is increased (-2 becomes -4 becomes -6).

**If the failure was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect  |
|:------|:-------|
|Even number |-1 drained from attacker's target battery, or another battery if at 0 |
|1, 5, 9     |-2 drained from attacker's target battery, or distributed across multiple batteries if at 0 |
|3, 7        |Attacker's health battery is drained as though they had attacked themselves; scale of 1 divided by 2, no resistance is applied, no less than 1 |
|11          |trauma |

If the follow-up roll was an 11, roll another 1d12. If the result of this follow-on roll was an 11, the tool being used is rendered useuless until repaired or replaced; if no tool was used, use 11 in the following instruction. Select from the secondary critical success table replacing the term "defender" with "attacker".

### Complication and partials extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

If the player rolls a 12 (instead of 1) on the criticality die (see "Criticality extension"). Complication means success happens and has an unforseen negative side effect. Partials means failure happens and has unforseen progress made.

## Movement

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA favors real time when practical and distinguishes between traveling and other forms of movement. Using cinematic terms traveling is a "time passes" cut between scenes, with the possibility of a montage or small scene to aid the narrative. Movement on the other hand is the same scene in roughly real time, linear progress of action and uses the mechanics of interacting with the setting.

Whether using theater of the mind, grid-based movement miniatures, live-action, all of the above, Fourth Earth SA supports you; consistently applied, players are aware (and appreciative), and fits the setting and theme.

### Initiative extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA uses initiative primarily to answer a single question: Will the action of a soon-to-be-subdued participant effect the outside world? 

In other words, initiative isn't about the order of actions, but the order of resolution with the possibility of neutralizing the outcome a participant.

Character A swings at character B. Character B swings at character A. The potential energy of character A, less the resistance of character B, would cause character B to be subdued. The potential energy of character B, less the resistance of character A, would cause character A to drain 3 points on their health. The following possibilities exist (two of which are the same):

1. If neither character has initiative, character A loses 3 and character B is subdued.
2. If character A has initiative, character B is subdued and nothing happens to character A; a successful hit from character B becomes a failure.
3. If character B has initiative, character A loses 3 and character B is subdued.

Characters who reduce the difficulty to 1 have an initiative of 0. Otherwise, initiative is the total number of 1s rolled in the action dice pool; so, initiative can range from 0 to 5 in Fourth Earth SA. Resolution is processed in descending order; all those with initiative 5, then 4, and so on until 0. Ties in initiative result in both actions happening.

This means skilled characters have a higher chance of doing their action and doing so in a way that another, less skilled opponent, doesn't get a last minute hit in. 

## Skills and tools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Skills and tools for the Fourth Earth setting are available in Fourth Earth Lore.

Skills are limited to 3 ranks. Tools are lmited to 1 rank. 4 successes are required to achieve a rank. 

### Sufficiently advanced technology and magic extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth Lore uses magic. Spells are tied to stones, carried by characters. Casting magic happens similar to using a tool; if the character has the stone, they can attempt to cast the spell. Each spell has a difficulty to cast. Spells can be classified as mundane and combat as well as occuring from the inside-out or the outside-in.
 
A spark spell, for example, might be a mundane, inside-out spell; a spark appears in the middle of inorganic material, usually with the hopes of starting a fire. A fire ball, might be a combat, outside-in spell; starting from the caster and hurled at a target, and taking the resistance of the target into account.

For combat spells, the difficulty level of the defender is reduced by half or 1 level, whichever is greater. If the calculated difficulty is greater than 8, difficulty level is 8; less than 0 becomes 0.

### Tool decay and destruction extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

See "Criticality extension" section.

### Becoming unskilled extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

See "Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation" section.

## Interacting with other living beings

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

**Calculating the difficulty** of a defender is done using qualities of the defender. If the running total for the calculated difficulty reaches level 8, the difficulty level is 8; no further considerations required. All difficulties start at level 0.

The following checklist aims to be brief and starts with qualities with the highest return up front:

|Question |Yes |
|:--------|:---|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? |Difficulty is 1 - no need to continue unless applied to the psychology and morality of the attacker. |
|Defender has active allies?    |+1 for every 2 active allies |
|Defender is lesser scale?      |+1 for every 2 steps lesser  |
|Defender is on higher ground?  |+1 |
|Defender is aware of attacker? |+1 |

**Calculating potential energy** starts by considering the type of attack partially based on tool used. The following table can be used as a base:

|Type |Description |Potential energy |
|:----|:-----------|:-----:|
|Jab                      |Fast and light  | 1-2 (2 requires 2 attempts) |
|Uppercut, kick, or ram   |Slow and medium | 2 |
|Dual (tool in each hand) |Fast and medium | 2-4 (4 requires 2 attempts) |
|Two-handed               |Slow and medium | 3 |
|Magic                    |Slow and heavy  | 5 |

Potential energy is not determined by the type of tool but the more general type of usage. The rationale here is, generally speaking, a bat, shovel, or longsword will do roughly the same amount of damage (though maybe not that same type) and the nuanced differences can be imagined or narrated. 

Fast means able to perform twice in a turn or round, players can choose to only do once. Slow means able to perform once in a turn or round. Fast attacks have the ability to split the difficulty level in half across both sub-actions, when both sub-actions are taken; otherwise, the full difficulty is used (the premise being that one swing helps prepare the second in some way). If the split results in a fraction, the difficulty level for the first sub-action is rounded down while the second is rounded up.

Consider the humanoid and the rat, using all extensions described in Fourth Earth SA; the humanoid is going to punch the rat with both fists:

**Calculating difficulty level:**

|Question |Yes |
|:--------|:---:|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? | --     |
|Defender has active allies?                   | 0 + 0  |
|Defender is lesser scale?                     | 0 + 5  |
|Defender is on higher ground?                 | --     |
|Defender is aware of attacker?                | --     |
|**Total**                                     | 5      |

**Calculating to hit (with both fists):**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Difficulty level 8                        |1 difficulty level 2 (d4) & 1 difficulty level 3 (d6) |
|Humanoid spends 2 physical points on both |1d2  |
|Humanoid has 2 ranks in unarmed combat    |3 dice in pool       |
|**Dice pool**                             |3d2                  |

**Calculating potential energy:**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Humanoid succeeds on both jabs           | base 2 potential engergy |
|Humanoid achieved criticality            | 2 * 2                    |
|Humanoid is 10 times scale               | 4 * 10                   |
|**Total potential energy**               | 40                       |

**Calculating drain:**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Potential energy                         | 40                  |
|Armor                                    | 40 - 0              |
|Skin                                     | 40 - (-1)           |
|**Total drain**                          | 41                  |

Given all life forms in Fourth Earth RAW apply the same rules, the rat would be dead; multiple times over, which could be described in the narration: The rat is a puddle of goo on the floor. 

### Resistance extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Every living being has a natural resistance, skin. Fourth Earth SA recognizes the following skin thickness and associated ability to resist potential energy:

|Thickness |Resistance |
|:---------|:---------:|
|Thin      | -1        |
|Average   | 0         |
|Thick     | 1         |

The rat from the previous section had thin skin; hence the -1. The humanoid would have average. And a whale would have thick skin, which means a human has to work extra hard to subdue or kill a whale.

Let's talk about the idea of a humanoid going against a whale. The whale would be easy to hit, effectively a difficulty 1, unless there were modifiers for being underwater. With that said, if a humanoid threw jabs at the whale, chances are they wouldn't be felt as injuries by the whale unless there were critical rolls involved; a punch that irritates an old wound and the whale dies from internal bleeding might happen:

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Humanoid succeeds on both                | base 2                 |
|Humanoid achieved criticality            | 2 * 2                  |
|Humanoid is 10 times scale               | 4 * 1/100              |
|**Total potential energy**               | 1 (can't be 0.04 or 0) |

The whale's thick skin resists 1 from the attack, making it 0.

Resistance doesn't make the thing impossible, only adjusts the difficulty.

There are three grades of armor recognized in Fourth Earth SA:

|Grade  |Absorption effect |
|:------|:----------------:|
|Light  | 1 |
|Medium | 2 |
|Heavy  | 3 |

### Scale extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Fourth Earth SA uses dynamic scale. For interactions where scale is used in calculations. The smallest participant is considered 1 and all other participants are a scale compared to that. Two humans would usually be 1 to 1, unless one of them was a giant twice the size of the other, at which point the giant would be 2 and the other would be 1.

### Subdue not kill extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Fourth Earth SA uses subdue by default. Subdued characters are unable to act for 4 rounds. Characters may declare their intent to kill and not subdue at any point in the session or game.
