# Fourth Earth SA

Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures) is an extension of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) intended for solo play. This play may occur in the Fourth Earth or an original setting with or without a facilitator.

## Creating a character

See Fourth Earth RAW.

You should have a way to track the 4 life batteries: health, physical, mental, and spirit.

## Action

See Fourth Earth RAW.

### Citicality extension

**Critical success of a non-combat action** results in the character succeeding and then rolling [.1d12](one twelve-sided die) to apply the associated side-effect from the following table:

|Result |Effect  |Narrative |
|:------|:-------|:---------|
|Even number |+1 |Elation from success! |
|1, 5, 9     |+2 |same                  |
|3, 7        |+3 |same                  |
|11          |+5 |same                  |

These points are applied to the target battery of the action. If that battery is or becomes full, the remaining points can be distributed as you see fit.

**Critical failure of a non-combat action** results in the same as the critical success only as a failure where the effect is negative not positive. If the target battery is at 0, the remaining points are used to drain the remaining batteries on a rotating basis to distribute the drain.

**Critical success of a combat action** results in the character succeeding and then rolling 1d12 to apply the associated side-effect from the following table:

|Result |Effect           |
|:------|:----------------|
|Even number |+1 to the battery used by the attacker or any other battery, if full |
|1, 5, 9     |base damage times 1.5 |
|3, 7        |base damage times 2   |
|11          |trauma (see next table) |

A roll of 11 causes another roll of 1d12 and using the following table:

|Result    |Effect  |
|:---------|:-------|
|1         |challenge level of defender reduced by -2, recurring and compounding |
|2, 5, 8   |-1 from defender's physical battery                     |
|3, 6, 9   |-1 from defender's mental battery                       |
|4, 7      |-1 from defender's spirit battery                       |
|10        |-1 from defender's health battery, recurring and compounding |
|11        |base damage times 3                                   |
|12        |defender is unable to act for 2 rounds                |

Note: "recurring and compounding" means the effect will occur every round until fixed and, if the effect applies again, it will be added to the already present effect. For example, a defender's challenge level was reduced by 2 in the first and third round of combat, the defener's challenge level has been reduced by 4 and will remain that way until fixed or combat is ended by the defender being subdued, killed, or retreating.

**Critical failure of a combat action** results in the attacker failing and then rolling 1d12 to apply the associated side effect from the following table:

|Result |Effect  |
|:------|:-------|
|Even number |-1 drained from attacker's target battery, or another battery if at 0 |
|1, 5, 9     |-2 drained from attacker's target battery, or distributed across multiple batteries if at 0 |
|3, 7        |Attacker's health battery is drained as though they had attacked themselves; scale of 1 divided by 2, no resistance is applied, no less than 1 |
|11           |damage a body part (see previous table, replacing "target's" with "attacking character's") |

A roll of 11 causes a roll of 1d12 using the second critical success for combat actions table, replacing the word "defender" with "attacker".

## Life batteries

There are four **life batteries**:

|Name |Convertable from |Cost to increase |
|:----|:----------------|:-------------------:|
|Health |physical, mental, and spirit | 3 |
|Physical |mental and spirit          | 2 |
|Mental   |physical and spirit        | 2 |
|Spirit   |physical and mental        | 2 |

The drain for conversion should be on a rotation basis to reach the cost to increase. In other words, taking 2 from mental to increase physical by 1 is not permitted.

### Draining health through combat

**Combat in Fourth Earth SA is round-based.** The order of turns in the round is based on initiative established by all participants rolling [.1d20](one twenty-sided die). In the case of a tie, those who tied re-roll; in cases of a large number of participants groups may be established and should remain as groups until combat ends. The sentient being with the lowest value goes first and the round proceeds in ascending order. Initiative is re-established at the beginning of each round.

**To calculate the challenge level of the defender** we consider its size compared to that of the attacker; the larger of the two
