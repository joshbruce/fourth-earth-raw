# Fourth Earth SA

Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures) is an extension of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) intended for solo play in a tabletop or pen and paper fashion. 

The setting may be based on Fourth Earth Lore. While the Fourth Earth setting is not strictly required the content found here is influenced by it.

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW.

You should have a way to track the 4 life batteries: health, physical, mental, and spirit.

Skin thickness should be known based on species: thin, average, or thick. See Calculating absorption subsection in Combat extras.

## Interacting with the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW.

### Challenge levels

See Fourth Earth RAW.

### Life batteries

See Fourth Earth RAW.

There are four **life batteries**:

|Name |Convertable from |Cost to increase |
|:----|:----------------|:-------------------:|
|Health |physical, mental, and spirit | 3 |
|Physical |mental and spirit          | 2 |
|Mental   |physical and spirit        | 2 |
|Spirit   |physical and mental        | 2 |

The health battery always tracks damage. The physical battery is used for all physical-oriented actions. The mental battery is used for all intellect-oriented actions. The spirit battery is used for all magic-related actions, at least.

Recharging batteries through action can be done by:

|Action        |Time to recharge |Target battery |Target battery increase per time unit |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-------------:|
|Rest          |Slow             |Health   | 2 |
|Nap           |Fast             |Physical | 3 |
|Sleep         |Fastest          |Physical | 4 |
|Meditate      |Fast             |Mental   | 3 |
|Revere (pray) |Fast             |Spirit   | 3 |

Each action has a unit of time to recharge, which is reflected in how many points are regained per unit of time. With every unit of time the area the character is performing the action provides a challenge level. Each action also has a maximum number of time units before naturally coming back to reality:

|Action |Maximum time units  |
|:------|:------------------:|
|Rest          | 1 |
|Nap           | 2 |
|Sleep         | 4 |
|Meditate      | 2 |
|Revere (pray) | 2 |

So, a character might say, "I want to rest in this swamp." The facilitator might respond, "Okay, roll 1d20 because this swamp is a crazy-scary place." If the character rolls a 1, they get 2 points added to their health battery and 1 to the others. If the character rolls anything else, something happened to cause the resting to fail; up to the storytellers what mechanics are used to explain this narratively.

Same character, this time they want to sleep in a privacy pod. Privacy pods have a challenge level of 0; so, the three rolls are not required.

### Dice pools

See Fourth Earth RAW.

Skills are limited to 3 ranks. Tools are lmited to 1 rank.

### Criticality extension

See Fourth Earth RAW.

Criticality is determined by rolling a 1 on [.1d10](one 10-sided die) following or in conjunction with rolling the action dice pool.

**If the success was critical on a non-combat action**, a side effect is randomly selected from the following table using [.1d12](one twelve-sided die):

|Result |Effect  |Narrative |
|:------|:-------|:---------|
|Even number |+1 |Elation from success! |
|1, 5, 9     |+2 |same                  |
|3, 7        |+3 |same                  |
|11          |+5 |same                  |

These points are applied to the target battery of the action (attack would be physical and magic would be spirit). If that battery is or becomes full, the remaining points can be distributed as you see fit; including the health battery.

**If the failure was critical on a non-combat action**, do the same thing for a non-combat critical success only using negative numbers not positive.

**If the success was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect           |
|:------|:----------------|
|Even number |+1 to the battery used by the attacker or any other battery, if full |
|1, 5, 9     |base damage times 1.5 |
|3, 7        |base damage times 2   |
|11          |trauma (see next table) |

If the follow-up roll was an 11, roll another 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result    |Effect  |
|:-------|:-------|
|1       |challenge level of defender reduced by -2, recurring and compounding |
|2, 5, 8 |-1 from defender's physical battery                     |
|3, 6, 9 |-1 from defender's mental battery                       |
|4, 7    |-1 from defender's spirit battery                       |
|10      |-1 from defender's health battery, recurring and compounding |
|11      |base damage times 3                                   |
|12      |defender is unable to act for 2 rounds                |

Recurring means the effect will occur every round until fixed. Compounding means if the same side-effect happens again, the effect is increased (-2 becomes -4 becomes -6).

**If the failure was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect  |
|:------|:-------|
|Even number |-1 drained from attacker's target battery, or another battery if at 0 |
|1, 5, 9     |-2 drained from attacker's target battery, or distributed across multiple batteries if at 0 |
|3, 7        |Attacker's health battery is drained as though they had attacked themselves; scale of 1 divided by 2, no resistance is applied, no less than 1 |
|11          |damage a body part (see previous table, replacing "target's" with "attacking character's") |

If the follow-up roll was an 11, roll another 1d12 to select from the secondary critical success table replacing the term "defender" with "attacker".

## Skills (or actions) and tools

See Fourth Earth RAW.

The skills and tools for Fourth Earth are available on the lore site. For those coming here to use Fourth Earth RAW, SA, TT, or CA for their own games, let's look at a couple of things:

|Name |Ranks |Skill or tool |
|:----|:-----|:-------------|
|Digging            |[x][x][x][x] |Skill |
|Two-handed weapons |[ ][ ][ ][ ] |Skill |
|Shovel             |[x]          |Tool  |

For some reason this character now needs to use this mundane tool as a weapon:

|Name |Ranks |Skill or tool |
|:----|:-----|:-------------|
|Digging            |[x][x][x][x] |Skill |
|Two-handed weapons |[x][ ][ ][ ] |Skill |
|Shovel             |[x]          |Tool  |

### Skill overlap extension 

Let's consider the idea of skill overlap. Where two skills have similar traits or qualities. 

Consider hiding and sneaking. Hiding is becoming unseen while still. Sneaking is remaining unseen while moving. If you want to keep the skill list short, as we do for Fourth Earth SA, both of these skills could be lumped into a single skill: stealth. However, maybe your game is targeted and themed for thieves and these two skills make sense as two separate concepts.

A character hides at a challenge level 1 and earns one point torward their rank in hiding. Now, that same character sneaks at a challenge level 1 and earns one point toward their rank in sneak *and* another point in hide. 

### Maintenance, decay, and loss extension

This can be a controversial topic with varying opinions on implementing it, especially in a solo adventure, pen and paper setting.

The topic hinges on two realities and one game mechanic:

1. The more often a tool is used (or not regularly maintained), the sooner it needs to be replaced.
2. The less often a skill is used (particularly at a certain level), the less able one is able to tap that level of mastery.
3. Role playing games often result in characters having tons of money and only spending that money on more prestigious tools, which results in the need to create more prestigious tools or wait for players to potentially become bored with a vault full of coins (similar to leveling and gaining experience).

The idea of decaying tools and skills is offered as an optional extension as we haven't found a viable pen-and-paper-friendly way to do it that falls in line with the values and principles of Fourth Earth RAW. Fourth Earth SA favors progression and prestige through actions performed and experiences had, not the chase for more and more powerful tools and skills (or levels).

Basic guidelines:

1. Decay is only tallied on characters actively playing the game; you shouldn't about opening a character who hasn't aged a day but whose tools are useless and somehow forgot how to do all they did before.
2. The player should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost, which should be recurring and automated by the facilitator or player, the schedule for which is agreed to by both; a tax.

#### Tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has 5 of that same item used on a rotating basis.

Consider a mundane item: a shirt. If I have one shirt and I wear it every day and wash it every night, it will not appear to last as long as if I had 100 shirts and only wore and washed the initial shirt every 100 days. With that said, the shirt itself has a lifespan based on wear time, usage, and maintainance. This is why I might be able to say I have a shirt that has lasted 15 years; it's not so much that the shirt has lasted 15 years, it's that I purchased it 15 years ago and it's not my only shirt and I only wear it to weddings.

#### Skills

Generally speaking, degradation of skills is proportional to how long it took to acquire that skill; they usually become rusty and require less time to reacquire.

Skill acquisition in Fourth Earth RAW is a blend of opportunity and success. Proficiency is directly tied to challenege level and simulate the idea of "the plateue" of a mastery curve. Therefore, any decay must be tied to and overcome by through natural or intentional gameplay for skill acquisition.

It is recommended that plays track the current rank of a skill and the highest rank of a skill (to guage the decay).

## Combat extras

See Fourth Earth RAW.

Fourth Earth SA distinguishes between the concepts of striking, potential energy, and energy absorbed.

### Subdue or kill extension

Fourth Earth SA uses subdue by default. The choice to kill can be made at any time as long as the defender is subdued.

For example, the attacker might subdue the defender and perform the killing stroke as a minor action during their current turn. The attacker might subdue and wait a couple turns before deciding to kill the defender; this would take at least the entire turn. The attacker might subdue, continue fighting, then subdue again if that defender wakes up and engages again.

### Calculating the challenge level

The challenge level is derived from qualities of the defender. If the running total for the calculated challenege level reaches 8, the challenge level is 8 and there is no need to continue with the questions. All challenges levels start at 0.

|Question |Yes |
|:--------|:---|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? |Challenge level is 0, no need to continue. |
|Defender has active allies?    |+1 for every 2 active allies |
|Defender is lesser scale?      |+1 for every 2 steps lesser  |
|Defender is on higher ground?  |+1 |
|Defender is aware of attacker? |+1 |

The list aims to be brief and go for quality (has greater potential for rapid increase), not quantity (a myriad of things to consider).

Consider a humanoid (scale of 10) versus a rat (scale of 1):

|Question |Yes  |No  |
|:--------|:---:|:--:|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? | | x |
|Defender has active allies?    | 0 + 0 | |
|Defender is lesser scale?      | 0 + 4 | |
|Defender is on higher ground?  | 4 + 1 | |
|Defender is aware of attacker? | 5 + 1 | |
|**Total**                      | 6 | |

Now consider the rat versus the humanoid:

|Question |Yes  |No  |
|:--------|:---:|:--:|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? | | x |
|Defender has active allies?    | 0 + 0 | |
|Defender is lesser scale?      | 0 + 0 | |
|Defender is on higher ground?  | 0 + 0 | |
|Defender is aware of attacker? | 0 + 1 | |
|**Total**                      | 1 | |

It's easier for the rat to hit the humanoid versus the humanoid hitting the rat.

### Calculating the potential energy

The minimum potential energy for a successful hit is 1.

Different attack types result in different potential energy. The following table is considered a minimal categorization and engery amount:

|Type |Description |Potential energy |
|:----|:-----------|:-----:|
|Jab  |Fast (twice per turn) and light | 1-2 (2 requires to attempts) |
|Uppercut or kick |Slow (once per turn) and medium| 2 |
|Dual (tool in each hand) |Fast and medium | 2-4 (4 requires to attempts) |
|Two-handed |Slow and medium | 3 |
|Magic |Very slow and heavy | 5 |

For the jab and dual types, players can decide to only use one attempt instead of two to get the most out of that type of attack. If the player choose to only swing once, the full challenge level is used to determine if the defender was hit. Otherwise, the challenge level is split; if the result of the split is a fraction, the first is rounded down while the second is rounded up (making the second swing slightly harder to land). The two new challenge levels are treated as two actions; they can just fit within one turn.

For details on magic, see the magic extension setion below.

Consider the humanoid and the rat; the humanoid is going to punch the rat with both fists:

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------:|
|Rat has challenge level of 6                          | 2 level 3 challenges       |
|Humanoid spends 2 physical points for both challenges | 2 level 1 challenges       |
|Humanoid rolls a critical success with criticality    | base potential energy of 2 times 2 from the criticality; total of 4 |
|The humanoid is 10 times the scale of the rat         | 4 times 10; total of 40 |
|Total potential energy                                | 40 |

If all of that potential energy gets through to the rat's health battery, it will be dead or subdued, twice over.

### Calculating absorption

Fourth Earth SA uses skin thickness to help information resistance to physical danger. There are three skin thicknesses:

|Thickness |Absorption effect |
|:---------|:----------------:|
|Thin      | -1               |
|Average   | 0                |
|Thick     | 1                |

The character has the potential energy of 40. The rat's skin thickness is thin; therefore, 41 points will be absorbed. Technically the rat has died a third time.

What if the rat was a robot with armor rated to absorb 20 and a skin thickness of thick?

40 - 20 - 1 = 19

This rat would have required at least two hits like the first.

Beyond skin, Fourth Earth SA include three grades or types of armor:

|Grade  |Type example |Absorption effect |
|:------|:------------|:----------------:|
|Light  |Cloth            | 1 |
|Medium |Leather          | 2 |
|Heavy  |Weave (or metal) | 3 |

The name of the grades refers to the level of absorption. The cloth example refers to cloth-based (padded) armor, not apparel.
