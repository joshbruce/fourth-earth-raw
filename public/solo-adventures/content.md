# Fourth Earth SA

Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures) is an expansion of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) intended for solo play in a tabletop or pen and paper fashion. Solo play means one player and optional narrator. That player may be playing more than 1 character.

## Creating the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

The setting and theme may use Fourth Earth Lore though is not required to.

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA uses 4 life batteries: health, physical, mental, and spirit.

## Interacting with the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Challenge levels

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Life batteries

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

There are **four life batteries**:

|Name     |Convertable from             |Cost to increase |
|:--------|:----------------------------|:---------------:|
|Health   |physical, mental, and spirit | 3 |
|Physical |mental and spirit            | 2 |
|Mental   |physical and spirit          | 2 |
|Spirit   |physical and mental          | 2 |

The health battery always tracks injuries. Action have an associated target battery, which means each battery tends to have a primary action category:

|Name     |Action category                             |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------------|
|Health   |Injury and healing                          |
|Physical |Physically dominant actions                 |
|Mental   |Mentallly or psychologically taxing actions |
|Spirit   |Magic- or spirituality-related actions      |

The primary recharging actions are as follow and do not represent all the ways of recharging batteries: 

|Action        |Time to recharge |Target battery |Target battery increase per time unit |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-------------:|
|Rest          |Slow             |Health         | 2 |
|Nap           |Fast             |Physical       | 3 |
|Sleep         |Fastest          |Physical       | 4 |
|Meditate      |Fast             |Mental         | 3 |
|Revere (pray) |Fast             |Spirit         | 3 |

For each unit of time all batteries are recharged. The target by the amount listed in the table above and the other by 1 each.

Because these are actions they can be given an associated challenge level. What happens on success and failure is whatever makes sense to the setting, theme, and players. For example, our characters are in on an airplane. They decide to go to sleep. It's loud and one of our characters is afraid of flying, for them it might be a challenge level 5 or 6 roll. Somehow they manage it; everyone gets the recharge for the first unit of time. They roll for the second unit; our friend who's afraid to fly fails. Then they fail the next one. Then they all fail the next one, which is good because the plane is going down. The character who's afraid to fly only got 1 round of recharge while everyone else got 3. The number of rolls and how much is replenished is entirely up to you and your players; it could be a completely safe place during a mundane period and the characters say, "We want to sleep" to which the narrator replies, "Cool. Everyone's batteries are full."

### Dice pools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Criticality extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Criticality is determined by rolling a 1 on [.1d10](one 10-sided die) following or in conjunction with rolling the action dice pool.

**If the success was critical on a non-combat action**, a side effect is randomly selected from the following table using the roll of [.1d12](one twelve-sided die):

|Result |Effect  |Narrative |
|:------|:-------|:---------|
|Even number |+1 |Elation from success! |
|1, 5, 9     |+2 |same                  |
|3, 7        |+3 |same                  |
|11          |+5 |same                  |

These points are applied to the target battery of the action (climbing a tree would be physical and magic would be spirit). If that battery is or becomes full, the remaining points can be distributed as the player sees fit; including the health battery.

**If the failure was critical on a non-combat action**, do the same thing for a non-combat critical success only using negative numbers instead of positive.

**If the success was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect           |
|:------|:----------------|
|Even number |+1 to the battery used by the attacker or any other battery, if full |
|1, 5, 9     |base potential energy times 1.5 |
|3, 7        |base potential energy times 2   |
|11          |trauma (see next table) |

If the follow-up roll was an 11 (an exploding die), roll another 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result    |Effect  |
|:-------|:-------|
|1       |challenge level of defender reduced by -2, recurring and compounding |
|2, 5, 8 |-1 from defender's physical battery                     |
|3, 6, 9 |-1 from defender's mental battery                       |
|4, 7    |-1 from defender's spirit battery                       |
|10      |-1 from defender's health battery, recurring and compounding |
|11      |base potential energy times 3 targeting the defender    |
|12      |defender is unable to act for 2 rounds                  |

Recurring means the effect will occur every round until fixed. Compounding means if the same side-effect happens again, the effect is increased (-2 becomes -4 becomes -6).

**If the failure was critical on a combat action**, results in rolling 1d12 to select from the following table:

|Result |Effect  |
|:------|:-------|
|Even number |-1 drained from attacker's target battery, or another battery if at 0 |
|1, 5, 9     |-2 drained from attacker's target battery, or distributed across multiple batteries if at 0 |
|3, 7        |Attacker's health battery is drained as though they had attacked themselves; scale of 1 divided by 2, no resistance is applied, no less than 1 |
|11          |damage a body part (see previous table, replacing "target's" with "attacking character's") |

If the follow-up roll was an 11, roll another 1d12 to select from the secondary critical success table replacing the term "defender" with "attacker". (See also the "Tool decay and destruction extension" section.)

### Complication and partials extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Roll a 12 on the same d12 used for criticality.

The outcome the complication or partial is left completely to the players and narrator.

## Movement

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA favors realtime when practical and distinguishes between traveling and other forms of movement. Using cinematic terms traveling is a "time passes" cut between scenes, with the possibility of a montage or small scene to aid the narrative. Movement on the other hand is the same scene in roughly realtime, linear progress of action and uses the mechanics of interacting with the setting.

### Initiative extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

Fourth Earth SA uses initiative primarily to answer a question: Will the action of a soon-to-be-subdued participant effect the outside world? In other words, initiative isn't about the order of actions, but the order of resolution with the possibility of neutralizing the outcome.

Character A swings at character B. Character B swings at character A. The potential energy of character A, less the resistance of character B, would cause character B to be subdued. The potential energy of character B, less the resistance of character A, would cause character A to drain 3 points on their health. The following possibilities exist:

1. If neither character has initiative, character A loses 3 and character B is subdued.
2. If character A has initiative, character B is subdued and nothing happens to character A; a successful hit becomes a failure.
3. If character B has initiative, character A loses 3 and character B is subdued.

Characters who reduce the challenge level to 0 have an initiative of 0. Otherwise, initiative is the total number of 1s rolled in the dice pool; so, initiative can range from 0 to 5. Resolution is processed in descending order; all those with initiative 5, then 4, and so on until 0. Ties in initiative result in both actions happening.

This means skilled characters have a higher chance of doing their action and doing so in a way that another, less skilled opponent, doesn't get a last minute hit in. 

## Skills and tools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Skills and tools for the Fourth Earth setting are available in Fourth Earth Lore.

Skills are limited to 3 ranks. Tools are lmited to 1 rank. 4 successes are required to achieve a rank. 

### Sufficiently advanced technology and magic extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

The Fourth Earth setting uses magic. Magic spells are tied to stones. Casting magic happens just like any other tool-assisted action. If the stone is in the character's posession, the spell can be cast. The challenge level of the defender is reduced by half, or 1, whichever is greater then increased by the challenge level of the spell itself. If the challenge is greater than 8, it becomes 8 and if it's 0 or less, the challenge level is 0. Spells that go from the outside-in should be adjusted by the defender's resistance rating; spells that go from the inside-out should *not* be.

## Interacting with other living beings

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

**Calculating the challenge level** of a defender is derived from qualities of the defender. If the running total for the calculated challenege level reaches 8, the challenge level is 8 and there is no need to continue with the questions. All challenge levels start at 0.

The following checklist aims to be brief and starting with qualities with the highest return up front:

|Question |Yes |
|:--------|:---|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? |Challenge level is 0, no need to continue unless applied to the psychology and morality of the attacker. |
|Defender has active allies?    |+1 for every 2 active allies |
|Defender is lesser scale?      |+1 for every 2 steps lesser  |
|Defender is on higher ground?  |+1 |
|Defender is aware of attacker? |+1 |

**Calculating potential energy** starts by considering the type of attack partially based on the tool used. The following table can be used as a base:

|Type |Description |Potential energy |
|:----|:-----------|:-----:|
|Jab                      |Fast and light  | 1-2 (2 requires 2 attempts) |
|Uppercut or kick         |Slow and medium | 2 |
|Dual (tool in each hand) |Fast and medium | 2-4 (4 requires 2 attempts) |
|Two-handed               |Slow and medium | 3 |
|Magic                    |Slow and heavy  | 5 |

Fast means able to perform twice in a turn or round, players can choose to only do once. Slow means able to perform once in a turn or round. Fast attacks have the ability to split the challenge level in half, when both sub-actions are taken; otherwise, the full challenge level is used (the idea being one swing of two helps distract for the second, with one, there is no distraction). If the split results in a fraction, the first is rounded down while the second is rounded up.

Potential energy is not determined by the type of tool but the more general type of usage. The rationale here is that, generally speaking, a bat, shovel, or longsword will do roughly the same damage and the nuanced differences can be imagined or narrated. 

Consider the humanoid and the rat, using all extensions described in Fourth Earth SA; the humanoid is going to punch the rat with both fists:

**Calculating challenge level:**

|Question |Yes |
|:--------|:---:|
|Defender is subdued, stunned, or unconscious? | --     |
|Defender has active allies?                   | 0 + 0  |
|Defender is lesser scale?                     | 0 + 10 |
|Defender is on higher ground?                 | --     |
|Defender is aware of attacker?                | --     |
|**Total**                                     | 8      |

**Calculating to hit (with both fists):**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Challenge level 8                        |2 level 4 challenges |
|Humanoid spend 2 physical points on both |2 level 2 challenges |
|Humanoid has 2 ranks in unarmed combat   |3 dice in pool       |
|**Dice pool**                            |3d4                  |

**Calculating potential energy:**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Humanoid succeeds on both                | base 2              |
|Humanoid achieved criticality            | 2 * 2               |
|Humanoid is 10 times scale               | 4 * 10              |
|**Total potential energy**               | 40                  |

**Calculating absorbed energy:**

|Description |Effect |
|:-----------|:------|
|Potential energy                         | 40                  |
|Armor                                    | 40 - 0              |
|Skin                                     | 40 - (-1)           |
|**Total absorbed energy**                | 41                  |

Given all life forms in Fourth Earth apply the same rules, the rat would be dead; twice over. 

### Resistance extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Every living being has a natural resistance, skin. Fourth Earth SA recognizes the following skin thickness and associated ability to absorb or resist potential energy:

|Thickness |Resistance |
|:---------|:---------:|
|Thin      | -1        |
|Average   | 0         |
|Thick     | 1         |

The rat from the previous section had thin skin; hence the -1. The humanoid would have average. And a whale would have thick skin, which means a human has to work extra hard to subdue or kill one.

Let's talk about the idea of a humanoid going against a whale. The whale would be easy to hit, effectively 0, unless there were modifiers for being underwater. With that said, if a humanoid threw jabs at the whale, chances are they wouldn't be felt by the whale unless there were critical rolls involved; a punch that irritates an old wound and the whale dies from internal bleeding. Resistance doesn't make the thing impossible, only adjusts the difficulty from a time scale.

There are three grades of armor recognizes in Fourth Earth SA:

|Grade  |Type example |Absorption effect |
|:------|:------------|:----------------:|
|Light  |Cloth            | 1 |
|Medium |Leather          | 2 |
|Heavy  |Weave (or metal) | 3 |

The name of the grades refers to the level of absorption. The cloth example refers to cloth-based (padded) armor, not apparel.

### Scale extension

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Fourth Earth SA uses dynamic scale. For interactions where scale is used in calculations the smallest participant is considered 1 and all other participants are a scale compared to that. Two humans would usually be 1 to 1, unles one of was a super human twice the size of the other, at which point the super human would be 2 and the regular human would be 1.

## Subdue not kill

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore). 

Fourth Earth SA uses subdue by default. Subdued characters are unable to act for 4 rounds. Characters maybe declare their intent to kill and not subdue at any point in the session or game.
