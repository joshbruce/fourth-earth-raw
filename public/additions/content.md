# Fourth Earth RAW: Additions

The following sections describe additions players may want in their systems; the list is neither limiting nor exhaustive.
 
Additions are designed to be self-contained while working together effectively. They can be used as needed, only once, or as an integral part of the setting. They can be added as play progresses or up front. 

This chapter offers descriptions and guidelines not implementations.

Guidelines:

1. Implementations should favor simplicity in keeping with Fourth Earth RAW values and principles (see Fourth Earth RAW introduction).
2. The additions and implementations should be known and agreed to (see Fourth Earth RAW “Player Pacts” section); even if the implementation is, "We'll figure it out when we get there” or “narrator discretion.”
2. Implementations should be consistently applied to all character types once in place (or renegotiated by players).
3. Avoid implementing all additions as integral features of the overall experience without assistance from tools or distributed administration (like a computer to automate an aspect or one player takes care of the calendar while another handles aging).

Consider:

- Weather affects characters on occasion.
- A character’s age only matters once a year in game-time.
- Ailments, however, are a prominent feature because the setting is a hospital during a plague.

## Setting

### Weather

In reality, weather isn’t entirely random and affects just about everything; from erosion to hunting to agriculture.

Guidelines:

1. May affect difficulty: harder to climb exterior walls in the rain.
2. May affect the lifespan of tools: a car hit by a tornado (see “Tool decay and destruction” addition).
3. May influence food availability: a drought ravages the land.
4. May influence reproduction (see “Offspring” addition).
5. May influence likelihood of illness (see “Ailments” addition).

### Sufficiently advanced technology and magic

One of Arthur C. Clarke's three laws is: 

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

A quote from William Gibson goes: 

> I think I actually believe that [possibly every] technology is morally neutral until you do something with it.

Settings will tend to have degrees of technology, abilities, or both.

Guidelines:

1. Technology and abilities may span from the mundane to the magnificent or rare.
2. Setting and characters should inform character responses.
2. Gameplay consistency and balance should be considered, characters can become boring if too perfect and indestructible.

Consider:

It is more common to see 5 or 10 year old cars on the streets of the United States than newer or older cars.

Or, character A is wandering down a farm road in America during the 1920s. They notice a ring on the ground. They compare the ring to the wedding band and high school class ring on their fingers. The simple, metal band seems boring in comparison; a mundane version of an already mundane thing. 

Character A slips the ring on their pinky finger anyway. 

When character A opens their eyes they find themselves on what appears to be a different planet. They’re surrounded by humanoids who aren’t human and are visually distinct from each other. The humanoids are all wearing the same ring and appear to be manifesting tangible objects using nothing more than their imagination and the ring; it has to be the ring, it’s the only thing they have in common. Character A looks down at the magical metal ring in shock.

Character A imagines a malt shake from their favorite soda shop, which immediately appears in their hand; complete with whipped cream and cherry on top. Character A feels a little confused (mental life battery drained by 1). They sniff the shake; smells fine. They take a sip. 

It *is* a shake from the soda shop!

Character A throws the glass to the ground and strips the ring from their finger.

Opening their eyes they’re back on Earth, ring in hand. Character A throws the ring as far as they can off the road and runs the opposite direction vowing never to speak of it or go to the soda shop again.

## Characters

### Overflow batteries

Overflow batteries simulate the ability for the character to give a little extra they didn’t know they had at the cost of other life batteries.

Guidelines:

1. Conversion cost should be more than 1: 2 points from the other(s) for every 1 point added to the target, for example.
2. Points drained for conversion should rotate through multiple life batteries, if possible; cost conversion and distribution outweigh player choice.

Consider:

4 batteries, the conversion cost is the number of overflow batteries for each battery. The health battery cannot be used as an overflow and cannot remain at 0. The health battery has 3 overflow batteries and the others each have 2. 

Player A spends 1 point from the physical battery; notice the character has 0 physical points available at the start: 

|Name     |Start |Increase |Spend |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1    |
|Physical | 0    | 1       | 0    |
|Mental   | 1    | 0       | 0    |
|Spirit   | 4    | 3       | 3    | 

1 point was taken from the mental and spirit batteries to raise the physical batter 1 point. 

Now consider a 1 point reduction to the health battery, which is already at 1:

|Name     |Start |Decrease |Increase |
|:--------|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Health   | 1    | 0       | 1       |
|Physical | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Mental   | 0    | 0       | 0       |
|Spirit   | 3    | 3       | 0       |


The health battery cannot remain at 0, unlike the other batteries. It costs 3 points to generate 1 point for the health battery. All 3 are taken from the spirit battery.

### Subdue 

Sometimes characters are put in positions where they cannot interact with the setting in whole or in part but aren’t dead.

Guidelines:

1. There should be a variety of ways to subdue characters.
2. Subduing a character should be the result of succeeding an action with a difficulty.
3. Consider potential side effects to life batteries, ranks, or other qualities to simulate recovery from being subdued.
4. Players should choose whether to subdue or kill by default.

Consider:

The players have chosen subdue by default.

Character A has dealt a blow to character B draining their life batteries. Character B is given 1 battery point and cannot act for 4 rounds plus 1 round of non-physical action.

Or, character A wants to subdue character B by sneaking up behind character B and hitting them with a blackjack. One or more difficulties are set and resolved. Character A succeeds, character B is subdued despite having points in other batteries.

### Resurrection

Resurrection happens when all (or one) of the character’s life batteries remains 0 and an outside force increases one or more batteries by at least 1.

Guidelines:

1. There should be a point where a character cannot be resurrected.
2. Resurrection should require an external force, not a roll by the player of a dead character: CPR, a defibrillator, a spell, an herb, whatever.
3. The character should experience a loss (simulating recovery).
4. The character can awaken in the same place they died.

Consider:

4 batteries, one of which is a health battery. If the health battery reaches 0, the character is dead. 

Character A is dead; upon death (not resurrection) all acquired ranks are reduced by 1 proficiency point. 

Character B casts a resurrection spell, which causes the health battery to recharge 1 point; the proficiency points remain lost.

### Reincarnation 

Reincarnation happens when a dead character is no longer able to be resurrected but can still be played.

Guidelines:

1. Should be immediately available if the resurrection addition is not used (see “Resurrection” addition).
2. The character should experience a loss; if used with the resurrection addition, the loss should be greater than or in addition to the loss applied for resurrection.
2. The loss should include losing all physical assets.
3. The character should awaken in a place other than where they died.

Consider:

4 batteries, one of which is a health battery. Character A is dead and decides to be reincarnated.

1. Death caused the loss of 1 proficiency point from all acquired ranks; reincarnation caused the loss of 1 more proficiency point from all acquired ranks.
2. Reincarnation caused the loss of all proficiency points from ranks not yet acquired.
3. All physical assets no longer have an owner and may be rediscovered by the character or another character.
4. The character is back in the location they started (or last rested).
5. While they may have the same name and body, they aren’t completely the same character; distinguishing reincarnation from resurrection. 

### Ailments 

Generally speaking, more people die from ailments than from war, adventures, or accidents.

Caution: 

The premise of this addition has been the primary feature of many intricate games and simulations. If it is not a prominent feature of the system, it may be difficult to balance simplicity, narrative, and simulation. 

Guidelines:

1. Keep the list of ailments short while having a variety of ways to contract them: airborne and open wound.
2. Use symptoms to affect character abilities and group symptoms to create ailments.
3. Most ailments aren’t terminal and should have a way to treat and recover from. 

Consider:

Character A is stricken with some type of pox while exploring a swamp.

The pox itch and burn, often distracting the character while moving (all difficulties related to physical movement are increased by 1; some difficulty 0 actions, become difficulty 1). The pox is also causing a fever and fatigue (all life batteries are reduced by 1 per kilometer of active travel).

Note the emphasis on symptoms not a specific, named ailment. Many ailments could involve burning, itching skin, fever, and fatigue.

### Offspring

Characters can have children. 

The implementation can be as simple or complex as the setting and player(s) allow.

Guidelines:

1. Rituals and circumstances should fit the setting and category of characters: legal papers, asexual or sexual reproduction.
2. Offspring should become playable after some “growing up” period beyond gestation, both of which could result in complications.
3. Favor nurture over nature: the neck of the giraffe didn’t get longer through stretching and passing that newly stretched neck trait to their offspring.  

Consider:

Sexual reproduction, within same species. 

Character A and character B decide to have a child (who will become character C). The setting is Medieval Europe. 

The offspring implementation causes the following:

1. Complications during pregnancy occur if a 1 is rolled on 1d10 (difficulty 5) and a payment of 100 gold pieces.
2. Child mortality occurs after birth and if a 1 is rolled on 1d12 (difficulty 6) and a payment of 1,000 gold pieces.
3. Players must wait until the third session after the child becomes an adult to play the offspring as a character. 

## Interacting with the setting

### Difficulty reduction

Being able to intentionally reduce the difficulty of an action at a cost can increase strategy and flow.

Guidelines:

1. Reduction should come at a cost; immediate, previously spent, or both.
2. Characters should still receive proficiency points as though they had performed the initial difficulty.

Consider:

We allow battery points and tools to reduce difficulty.

Character A has 2 ranks in a skill related to the action.

Character A is presented with a difficulty 3. Player A (playing character A) spends 2 battery points to reduce the difficulty to 1. Player A has character A use a tool that reduces the difficulty by 1; now 0.

Character A still earns 1 proficiency point to the third ranks of both the skill and the tool, if available.

### Criticality

Sometimes a success is more than a success and a failure is more than a failure; a perfect bullseye versus missing the target entirely.

Guidelines:

1. Criticality should result in an advantage or disadvantage being applied. 
2. Minimize consecutive rolls unless they escalate the outcome (sometimes called “exploding dice”).
2. Separate criticality from success or failure; criticality doesn’t change the result, only severity and impact.
3. Players should know what types of actions include criticality: no criticality on negotiations, for example.
4. Players should know whether criticality is always possible or can be opted into prior to rolling success or failure.

Consider:

Character A wants to climb a tree (difficulty 2). Player A adds an extra die to the pool (the criticality die). The action roll was a success and the criticality die landed on 1, making the result a critical success.

### Complications and partials

Also known as “Yes, but...” or “No, and...” Yes, they succeeded, but...(something negative). Or no, they failed, and...(something positive).

Guidelines:

1. See “Criticality” extension.
2. The implementation should allow seamless integration with other additions, specifically criticality.
3. Complications should *hinder* progress following a success while partials should *support* progress following a failure. 
4. Players should know what types of actions can include complications and partials.
5. Players should know whether complications and partials are always possible or can be opted into prior to rolling success or failure.

Consider:

Character A wants to climb a tree (difficulty 2). Player A adds an extra die to the pool (the complications die, which may be the same as the criticality die). The action roll was a success. The complications die lands on the highest number (instead of 1 for criticality), making the result a success with complications.

Character A cut their hand on the way up; actions involving the hands have an increased difficulty. 

### Re-roll

Sometimes the dice don't cooperate and players would like a way to modify their roll.

Guidelines:

1. The ability to re-roll should come at a cost to the player.
2. Re-rolling a pool should feel cheaper than re-rolling a single die.

Consider:

Player A rolls a failure and pays 1 battery point to re-roll the entire pool.

Player A rolls a success with a complication (see “Complications and partials” addition) and pays 2 battery points to re-roll the complication die by itself in the hopes of not rolling another complication while guaranteeing the success won’t change to failure.

See “Fate points” section.

### Multi-faceted actions

Actions rarely require only one aspect (battery) of a character. Battery overflows can compensate for this, multi-faceted actions directly support it (see “Overflow batteries” addition). 

Guidelines:

1. The action’s primary battery should be the same for all characters added batteries and difficulties should be character specific.
2. The number of batteries targeted should be less than 4.

Consider:

Character A wants to kill a spider (physical difficulty 1). Character A has a fear of spiders and needs to overcome the fear long enough to kill the spider (mental difficulty 5).

Instead player A resolving the mental difficulty separate from the physical difficulty as two separate actions or rolls, they can be combined; a difficulty 6.

The player can spend 1 physical and (up to) 5 mental to reduce the difficulty (see “Difficulty reduction” section).

## Interacting with characters

### Resistance

Potential energy being converted to received energy.

**Terms:**

- Potential energy: The amount of energy generated by an action (usually an attack).
- Resistance: How much potential energy is absorbed before having an impact; potential energy minus resistance is received energy.
- Received energy: The amount of energy remaining from an action (usually an attack) after accounting for resistance.

Guidelines:

1. Resistance should be easy to calculate.
2. Resistance should use qualities of the defender that help them block or absorb energy not evade.

Consider:

Character A is in a superhero setting. Character A fires a gun at character B who is super human. After processing difficulty we find character A is going to hit character B. 

The potential energy of the bullet is 5. Character B has a resistance of 10. The received energy is 0.

### Scale

Scale describes size, mass, and volume of characters and objects compared to each other.

Guidelines:

1. Scales can be dynamic or static, favor the dynamic; dynamic scale is determined per interaction, while static scale is determined at the time of character or object creation.
2. Scale should affect impact.
3. Scale should affect difficulty to hit; larger things are easier to hit than smaller things.

Consider:

A car accident using a dynamic scale. A motorcycle (scale 1) is hit by a truck (scale 5 times that of the motorcycle), which is hit by a semi-truck and trailer (scale 50 times that of the motorcycle); no one is injured. 

The truck does 10 damage to the motorcycle; 5 points on initial impact and another 5 points when the semi pushed the truck into the motorcycle (the truck is 5 times the scale of the motorcycle).

The motorcycle did 2 damage to the truck; 1 point each time the truck hit the motorcycle. The truck takes another 10 damage from the semi-truck (10 times the scale of the truck).

The truck does 5 damage to semi (the truck is one-tenth the scale).

The motorcycle and truck are both destroyed; the semi appears to still be drivable despite the damage. The motorcyclist jumped off the bike when it appeared the truck couldn’t slow down. The driver of the truck leapt out to help the motorcyclist once they managed to stop the truck. The semi driver seems fine. 

If the semi-truck had hit the motorcycle, the motorcycle would have taken 50 damage (50 times scale).

If two semis went head-to-head using a dynamic scale, both would take 1 damage, a one-to-one scale.

How about two semis using a static scale where semis are scale 50?

1. Both could generate 50 points of potential energy and possibly have a higher resistance.
2. The scales could be converted to a ratio, which would be one-to-one, simulating a dynamic scale.
3. Or some similar solution.

### Stance

Stance affects a character’s difficulty to hit or evade.

Guidelines:

1. Stance can be changed at the beginning of a character’s turn and should remain the same until their next turn.

Consider:

Character A is attacking character B. Character B is attacking character A. 

Character A takes takes an offensive stance reducing the difficulty to hit of both character A and B by 1; both are easier to hit.

They hit one another.

At the beginning of their next turn, player A switches to a defensive stance

Player A, at the beginning of their next turn, switches to a defensive stance increasing the difficulty to hit of both by 1; both are harder to hit.

### Roll to evade

An alternative to players rolling for opponents. Some refer to this as an "only players roll" setup.

Guidelines:

1. If using difficulty reduction:
	- opposing characters should have a default spending behavior (see “Difficulty reduction” addition) and
	- the player character should be able to spend battery points to increase their likelihood to evade.
2. Calculating initial difficulty should be based on qualities of the player character not the opposing character.

Consider:

NPC A attacks character B. Character B’s initial difficulty is 5. 

NPC A must reduce it to 2 because they can. 

The mirror difficulty is 5, which player A reduces to 3 and rolls; rolling to evade not hit. 

NPC A attacks again. Difficulty is still 5. NPC A can’t reduce it. Mirror difficulty is 2, which player A reduces to 0, avoiding the attack; no roll necessary.

### Assist

Fourth Earth RAW supports cooperative play at a high-level; characters may work together toward common goals over the course of multiple rounds and sessions. The assist addition facilitates the creation of low-level mechanics; characters may work together within a single turn.

Note:

Typically used when action resolution is turn-based.

Guidelines:

1. There should be risk or cost to all players and characters.
2. Assisting aid the turn of another; therefore, should be lower difficulty and take less game-time.
3. Assisting characters should come as they are and go as they were.
4. If an assisting character is (or becomes) subdued or dead before the assisted character’s action is resolved, the assist from the subdued or dead character is cancelled. 
5. Should not be used during mundane interactions or scenes; just let characters help each other without concern of failure or cost.

Consider:

Character A wants to shoot NPC A who is a physical difficulty 3. Character A is out of physical battery points and is also out of bullets for a firearm they’re holding. 

Character B is carrying a full speed loader, which can reload the firearm in less than a turn. Character C has a full physical battery and can transfer 3 points to Character A.

The player(s) decide the characters assist character A in the following ways:

1. Character B will toss the speed loader to Character A (physical difficulty 2).
2. Character C will put their hand on character A’s shoulder and transfer 3 physical battery points to character A.

Player B reduces the cost of the toss to 0 (physical battery reduced 2 points).

Character A catches the speed loader and reloads the firearm. 

Character B places their hand on character A’s shoulder and calmly says, “You got this” (character B reduces their physical battery 3 points while character A increases their physical battery 3 points).

Character A takes a breath, raises the firearm, aims, and fires (player A spends 3 physical battery points reducing the difficulty to 0).

The shot hits. NPC A falls to the ground, dead.

1. Characters B and C still have turns (actions that can be resolved).
2. Character A gained 1 proficiency point for ranged weapons and the firearm specifically (at the third rank, if applicable). (See “Skills and tools” addition.)
3. Characters B and C do not gain anything; at least not directly.

## Ranks

### Skills and tools

Skills and tools are a common way for characters to increase success probability and possibly reduce difficulty. 

Guidelines:

1. Skills should have more ranks than most tools; unless the tool is particularly complex, specialized, or both. 
2. Ranks in skills represent proficiency in an action while ranks in tools represent tool knowledge; therefore, tools are not coupled to a specific action. 

Guidelines for skills:

1. Skills should not be limited to certain types of characters; anyone can try to swing a sword, climb a wall, or cast a spell.
2. Available skills can be added as play proceeds as opposed to choosing a subset from a predetermined list.
3. Skills may overlap where performing an action gains proficiency points in more than one rank.
4. Skills used by characters may inform the creation of additional life batteries. 

Consider:

Characters in our game are consistently performing actions requiring stealth. We add a stealth life battery to compensate. 

We also decide the hiding and sneaking skills overlap; both involve being unseen and only one requires movement.

Character A has no ranks in any skill. 

Character A succeeds a difficulty 1 hide; earning 1 proficiency point in hiding. Character A succeeds a difficulty 1 sneak; earning 1 proficiency point in both hide and sneak.

Notice hiding by itself did not improve sneaking.

Guidelines for tools:

1. Tools may decrease difficulty, regardless of rank: characters could whittle wood with their fingernails but it would be easier with a knife.
2. Tools may be added to the setting as play continues. 

Consider:

Character A is a grave digger and has 1 rank using a shovel and 3 ranks in digging. When digging with a shovel, 5 dice are in the pool. 

Zombie hoards begin roaming the graveyard. 

Character A swings the shovel at a zombie; there are 2 dice in the pool, 1 base die and 1 for the rank in using a shovel. Character A succeeds and gains 1 proficiency point toward the first rank in bludgeon weapons.

If character A switches to a baseball bat, the pool would drop to 1 die until a rank in the bat was gained.

## Time and space

### Initiative

Initiative is used to facilitate action across multiple characters (and players).

The questions to answer are:

1. How are actions planned?
2. When do individual players roll for their characters?
3. How are the rolls resolved?

**Terms:**

- Round: Unit of time in which all active participants take a turn.
- Turn: Unit of time in which one participant performs an action.
- Minor action: Unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed: pull pin from grenade.
- Main action: Unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed: throw grenade.
- Post-minor action: Unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed: yell "Duck" and do so.

Note: Minor and post-minor actions may be incorporated into the main action (see “Assist” addition).

General guidelines:

1. Let the current state of the players, game, and narrative inform whether to be more real-time, turn-based, or allow more strategic, group planning.
2. There should be a mechanism for determining a sequence of events.
3. Players should know whether the encounter is strictly individual planning, group planning, or a combination.

Consider:

While playing with a narrator the group uses a double pass, round-robin, and turn-based approach. 

The narrator chooses a random player, player A. Player A states the intent of their character. The narrator assigns a difficulty for that plan and moves to player B, giving player A time to determine how to address the difficulty. Player B states their character’s intent - the narrator assigns a difficulty.

The narrator finishes going around and returns to player A who has decided to reduce the level and roll. They succeed. The narrator (or player or both) describe the success. The turn for player A is resolved. 

The narrator continues with character B and the other characters. 

Guidelines favoring real-time:

1. All dice pools should be rolled at the same time.
2. The narrative and order should be based on the rolls.

Consider:

3 players and 6 characters attacking 6 opposing characters (12 in total). The intent of each character is determined in private then revealed at the same time. 

Each intent is given a difficulty. For difficulties greater than 0, dice pools are created and rolled. 

The more 1s rolled in the pool, the higher the initiative. Actions for characters with a higher initiative are resolved first and those with 0 initiative go last (including failures). Characters may become subdued as actions are resolved; thereby, canceling or interrupting the action.

Guidelines for turn-based:

1. A time limit or other cost should be used if planning interrupts flow; mitigates hour long planning sessions.

Consider:

3 players, 3 characters, and 6 opposing characters. 

The players decided that order would alternate between their characters and opposing characters in a clockwise fashion for turns (and encounters).

For this encounter, player B starts. 

Player B starts a 4 minute timer representing the real-time for the round (roughly 10 seconds game-time). Player B speaks their character’s intent, it’s given a difficulty, and they resolve their turn. 

Two of the opposing characters, also played by player B, do the same. 

Player C goes next doing the same. Player A finishes the round. And it continues until the encounter is complete.

At the next encounter, player C starts.

### Encumbrance

Encumbrance describes anything inhibiting a character’s ability to move due to carrying or dragging something; for injuries inhibiting movement, see "Ailments" addition.

Guidelines:

1. Favor simplicity over realism.
2. Most tangible items can be carried or dragged; use the mass, volume, and carrying style to determine difficulty and side effects.
3. The encumbrance should affect the character's ability to interact with the setting.

Consider:

Character A becomes subdued (unconscious). Character B wants to drag them to safety. 

Character A has an available carrying capacity of 10. Character B has a base carrying value of 5 adjusted to 15 because of how much stuff character B is carrying. 

Character A decides to drop some of their own items to increase carrying capacity. Character A decides to reduce the carrying value of character B by removing their backpack and dragging them instead of lifting them off the ground.

While dragging character B, character A is committed to dragging and can't do anything else unless they stop.

### Aging

This addition refers to the aging of characters; there are other additions for skill atrophy and tool decay.

Guidelines:

1. Favor simplicity over generalized or specific realism: time spent in and out of sun aging characters differently.
2. Costs due solely to aging may feel ageist, beware; not all elders have arthritis and trouble getting out of bed and not all you party all night.
3. Benefits due solely to aging (not experience) may feel ageist, beware; “Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it” (George Orwell).

### Tool decay and destruction

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day decays faster than if use rotates across five similar items.

Guidelines:

1. Items should be given a useable life; represented by time, uses, a combination, or other measurement.
2. The implementation should be easy to manage and administer; an item with a twenty year lifespan probably isn't worth tracking unless it becomes an heirloom (see “Offspring” addition).
3. Implementation of this addition may be done through other additions: the criticality addition may have a failure causing a tool to become useless (see “Criticality” addition).
4. Tool decay should be tallied when a character is actively playing; a player shouldn’t be concerned about losing all their tools and skills because “time waits for no player.”
5. The player(s) should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost; a maintenance tax.

Consider:

There’s a shirt purchased fifteen years ago, it's one of one hundred and only worn during weddings. Compare that shirt to one worn every day and washed every night. 

Chances are both shirts lasted a similar number of wearable time and wash cycles but the perception is that the first shirt lasted longer because date of purchase is the reference point not wearable hours.

### Rank loss

Fourth Earth RAW does not implement a mechanic for ranks. As such there is no implementation for losing proficiency points, which means characters can become (and remain) a rank in all ways available; not how life typically works.

Guidelines:

1. Favor simplicity and loss as a side-effect of some other implementation.
2. A rank should rarely, if ever, return to 0; it tends to take less effort to regain a  previously held proficiency than it took to initially attain it.
3. There should be fewer high-level difficulties than low-level difficulties, which helps maintain overall balance.
4. Performing a difficulty should rejuvenate proficiency points of lower ranks.
5. The player(s) should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost; a maintenance tax (see "Tool decay and destruction" addition).

Consider:

See “Reincarnation” addition.

## Player pacts

### West Marches

“West Marches” is a term used to describe a style of play tending to be more player-driven and -focused, which may help resolve pragmatic problems in player groups.

The West Marches style emphasizes exploration and setting over characters thrust into plot lines. Characters are born into a setting and explore that setting; many multiplayer online video games use this style.

**Terms:**

- Player pool: All players playing characters in the same setting on a similar timeline.

Basic guidelines:

1. A player can choose to have their own adventure or join a group.
2. If there is a separate narrator, players coordinate with them regarding session content and timing; if player content overlaps, a group may form for a single session encompassing what all players wanted to accomplish separately only together.
3. There is no limit to the size of the player pool; however, group sizes should be large enough to accomplish the goal(s) and small enough to facilitate flow.
4. When the character (not the player) is in a position to share what happened to the character they should do so; setting technology can be used to help here.
5. The player pool should share the same setting and general timeline; a character cannot be in two places at once and character knowledge should be limited to first hand experience or something learned through other means.
6. Goal(s) should be in one session.

Guidelines (extended, even more optional):

1. Each session starts and ends in the same location; how this is accomplished and communicated should be setting-, theme-, and character-appropriate.
2. Limit how often certain players form groups with the same player(s) to mitigate forming multiple cliques or small parties with the same player pool; conversely, this could be a way for certain players to avoid other players before resolving an underlying issue, which we hope they do.
3. If using a separate narrator, it may be worthwhile to have multiple narrators available to accommodate multiple sessions running simultaneously or on different real-time days close together; or, consider which sessions can be run by one or more players without a narrator (technically all of them).

Consider:

2020 Earth.

Player A goes on a session using character A. Character A enters a cave and discovers it's too much for them to go with the supplies they brought or by themselves. Character A leaves the cave, makes a call on their satellite phone, to character B (played by player B) to see if they can assist.

Player A and B decide to schedule a different session for them to bring supplies and help with the cave.

The following session starts with the story of character B getting to character A and continues with both of them entering the cave with the necessary supplies.

### Fate points

Fate points are a positive and negative reenforcement mechanism allowing the player(s) or narrator to have actions in the real world affect current or future in-game narrative and situations in positive or negative ways.

Guidelines:

1. Should feel special and earned; there are simpler ways to make it easier (or harder) for characters without introducing a new mechanic (increase or decrease battery points for characters but not non-player characters, for example).
2. Should be consumable in an agreed to, semi-predictable or very predictable way.
3. When points are awarded, an announcement should be made as to how many (usually 1) and what behavior prompted the award; when points are awarded in response to undesirable behavior, it may be beneficial to give warning before the point is awarded, “I’m going to award a fate if...continues.”
4. If it seems fate points are the root cause of negative behavior, they should be reset, re-engineered, or removed immediately.
5. See “Re-roll” and “Assist” sections.

Consider:

Players (including the narrator) are given an extra life battery called fate that starts at 0. The players agree on what circumstances allow points to be added. The players agree on a flow for spending fate and under what circumstances.

The narrator awards player A 1 fate point. Player A adds a fate point to the fate battery.

The players spend a lot of time planning one how to get through a door. The narrator says, "In 10 seconds I'm going to start awarding myself fate."

A few seconds later, the narrator says, “I’m awarding myself 1 fate for indecisiveness” and adds 1 point to their fate battery.

The players make a decision and step through the door. The narrator says, “I’m going to spend 1 fate.”

Player A was going to use their fate points as a battery overflow but decides otherwise, "I will spend 1 fate to stop you."

Player A and the narrator reduce their fate batteries by 1 point.

The players don't learn (at this time) that the narrator was using their fate point to put a skeleton key on the ground for the next (and all future) door(s).

Repeat.
