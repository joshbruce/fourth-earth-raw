# Fourth Earth RAW: Extensions
 
The following extensions describe considerations for Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) that, when implemented, may heighten immersion, offer a way to overcome obstacles, some combination, or something else entirely.

Extensions are designed to be used as needed or as part of initial setting creation. Extensions can be added one-by-one or all-at-once. These are descriptions with guidelines not implementations.

Guidelines:

1. Implementations should favor simplicity in keeping with the Fourth Earth RAW values and principles.
2. The extensions and implementations should be known and agreed to (see “Player Pacts” section); even if the implementation is, "We'll figure it out when we get there” or “narrator discretion.”
2. Implementations should be consistently applied (or renegotiated) once in place.
3. Don’t implement all extensions as a permanent and prominent part of the overall experience without assistance through tools (like a computer), you would spend more time administering the extensions than pushing the plot forward; maybe weather is something that only affects characters on occasion, meanwhile how old characters are only needs to be known once every year in game-time, but the setting is hospital during the bubonic plague, making sickness and disease an almost turn-by-turn feature. 

## Weather

**Extends:** Setting

Weather affects just about everything in a setting. From the erosion of mountains to hunting conditions to agriculture. While there are many jokes regarding the unpredictable nature of weather, it’s not entirely random.

Guidelines:

1. May affect difficulty; harder to climb in the rain.
2. May affect the lifespan of tools; a car hit by a tornado (see “Tool decay and destruction” extension).
3. May influence food availability.
4. May influence reproduction (see “Offspring” extension).
5. May influence likelihood of illness (see “Sickness and disease” extension).

## Offspring

**Extends:** Populating the setting

Characters can have children. 

The implementation can be as simple or complex as the setting allows.

Guidelines:

1. Rituals and circumstances should fit the setting and category of characters; legal papers, asexual or sexual, interbreeding across species.
2. Offspring should become playable after some gestation beyond pregnancy, gestation could result in complications: eggs buried on a beach, a certain number of sessions must pass, in-game time.
3. Favor nurture over nature: the neck of the giraffe didn’t get longer through stretching and passing that newly stretched neck trait to their offspring.  

## Sickness and disease

**Extends:** Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

In past societies many people died of disease long before old age or battle took them. In “modern” societies people still die more of sickness or disease and old age can be considered a contributing factor in contracting illness in many cases (see “Time and aging” extension).

Implementing this extension could be (has been the subject of) its own game; beware. 

Guidelines:

1. Develop lists of various illnesses characters could experience ahead of time.
2. Keep the list of potential illnesses minimal, while having a variety of ways to contract the illness and a variety of effects; vomiting is a common effect of many illnesses (and treatments), which could be contracted through airborne transference (common) or ingestion (uncommon) or abrasion or cut (rare).
3. Use regions and weather to help keep the lists small. 
4. Consider a means to recovery if there is one (see “Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation” section); this is a multi-billion dollar a year industry.

## Time and aging

**Extends:** Movement *and* Populating the setting

Time mechanics can be hard. 

There’s the passage of time itself, the tracking mechanisms for the passage of time (calendars and clocks), and the side effects of the passage of time.

Is the passage of game-time a ratio of real-time? What day is it? What happens when my character gets older?

Guidelines:

1. Favor simplicity using familiar methods: position and relationship of celestial bodies in the setting, the half-life of atoms, one session is one day or season.
2. Favor separating game-time from real-time then track and regularly announce the passage of game-time.  
3. Establish life expectancies for nouns: the erosion of a mountain is longer than the life of a tree uninhibited and the life of an uninhibited tree is longer than most characters. (Possibly include skills and tools, see “Tool decay and destruction” and “Becoming unskilled” extensions.)

## Only players roll

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

All characters must have a player; however, a distinction is often made between players and the narrator (or similar title) and players playing them. These “special” players often perform and roll in private, which can maintain tension and sometimes erode trust. Are they “fudging their rolls” to make it better or worse for the other players?

In cases like these, the narrator or player acting as narrator doesn’t roll any dice. Instead, when it comes to interacting with the world, their abilities tend to be limited to modifying difficulty either by the type of antagonists, the difficulty of actions, or both.

Examples:

1. Players roll to hit and defend against being hit with the non-player attackers always decreasing the difficulty level of hitting by a specified amount (50 percent, for example).
2. Players roll to hit for both sides of the interaction. This could be the same player or two different, non-narrator, players.

Guidelines:
 
1. It should be possible to succeed.
2. The implementation should reduce the opportunity or desire for players to invert the balance of the game; if the game is hard, it should stay that way - if it's easy, it should stay that way.

## Criticality

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a success is more than a success and a failure is more than a failure; a swish in basketball versus a brick that break the backboard. Such things can be narrated and it may be helpful to have the dice remind players and narrators to describe things beyond “you succeeded.”

Examples:

1. Have two pools of at least 1 die each (or 1 extra die), which can be rolled simultaneously; the action pool and the criticality pool.
2. Roll the dice pool and draw a card where criticality is represented by a certain percentage of the deck.

Guidelines:

1. Minimize the number of consecutive rolls.
2. Separate success or failure entirely from criticality; criticality doesn’t change the result, only severity and impact.

## Complications and partials

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a failure isn't a total failure (and it's not a critical failure); same with success. This is where complications and partials come in.

Maybe a character successfully climbs a tree but received the complication of a twisted ankle. Maybe the same character fails to climb a tree but received the partial of finding a less difficult route.

Examples:

1. Have two pools of at least 1 die each (or 1 extra die), which can be rolled simultaneously; the action pool and the complications pool (could be the same as the criticality pool, if using criticality).
2. Roll the dice pool and draw a card where complications and partials are represented by a certain percentage of the deck.

Guidelines:

1. See “Criticality” extension.
2. Because they close let related it’s worth repeating the overall guideline for extensions; the implementation of complications and partials should be such that it can be seamlessly used with or without any other extension, specifically criticality.
3. Complications hinder further progress following a successful completion while partials support further progress following a failed attempt. 

## Re-roll

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes the dice don't cooperate and players would like a way to modify their roll.

Examples:

1. Players may re-roll the entire pool at the cost of a proficiency or battery point.
2. Players may re-roll a single die in the pool at a higher cost than re-rolling the entire pool; to remove a complication, for example.

Guidelines:

1. The ability to re-roll should come at a cost to the player.
2. The cost of re-rolling an entire pool should feel less expensive than re-rolling a single die; a second roll of a pool has the same probability of success while rolling a specific die has a higher probability of turning a negiative to a positive, or vice versa.

## Multi-faceted actions

**Extends:** Difficulty *and* Life batteries 

It’s rare that an action requires only one aspect (life battery) of a character. While using overflows can compensate for this, multi-faceted actions directly support it. 

Example:

Character A wants to kill a spider, a physical difficulty 2 (level 1) action. Character A has a fear of spiders, overcoming that fear is a mental difficulty 10 (level 5) for them. Instead of treating these as two, separate actions we can combine the difficulty levels to arrive at a difficulty 12 (level 6). 

To reduce the level, the player can spend 1 physical, up to 5 mental, or both; the player cannot, however, spend 6 physical or 6 mental alone.

Guidelines:

1. The primary battery for the action should be generic to the action (all players experience this), while the second battery is specific to the character.
2. While multi-faceted actions can involve as many as you like, it’s recommended it stay under 4; difficulties begin to feel diluted and harder to keep reasonable (less than difficulty level 5).

## Initiative

**Extends:** Movement

Initiative is a mechanism used to facilitate action across multiple characters (and players).

The questions to answer are:

1. How are actions planned and executed?
2. When do individual players execute or roll for their characters?
3. How are the rolls resolved?

Some terms:

1. Round: A unit of time in which all active participants perform an action.
2. Turn: A unit of time in which one participant performs their action.
3. Minor action: A unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed; pull pin from grenade.
4. Main action: A unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed; throw grenade.
5. Post-minor action: A unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed; yell "Duck" and do so.

Note: Minor and post-minor actions may be incorporated into the main action.

Examples:

1. One player explains their intent to the narrator who assigns an initial difficulty before moving to the next player(s) (see “Difficulty” section); while other players go through the process, players who have already gone can decide how they might reduce the difficulty and prepare dice pools.
2. Once the narrator knows the intent of all the players and the players know the difficulty they’re up against, all players (including the narrator) roll their dice, if applicable.
3. Actions are then resolved based on how many 1s were rolled per pool; no roll is 0 and resolved last while pools of all 1s are resolved first.

General guidelines:

1. Let the current state of players, the game, and the narrative inform whether to be more real-time or more group strategic planning.
2. There should be a mechanism for determining a sequence of events.
3. Players should know whether the encounter is strictly individual planning, group planning, or a combination.

Guidelines favoring real-time:

1. All dice pools should be rolled at the same time.
2. The narrative and order should be based on the rolls.

Gudelines for turn-based:

1. A time limit or other cost should be known and agreed to if planning begins interrupting flow; mitigates hour long planning sessions.

## Encumbrance

**Extends:** Movement

How much can a character carry?

It’s likely that any tangible thing encountered could be carried so long as the character has the strength to overcome its weight and scale; of course, this could add up quickly and make it difficult for the character in some way.

Examples:

1. Each character is given a carrying capacity.
2. Every tangible thing can have a carry value; including characters.
2. Every item or group of items with a carry value equal to or greater than 1 reduces the carrying capacity of the character by that amount.
3. At one or more ranges of capacity, the character experiences a side effect.

Character A becomes subdued (unconscious). Character B wants to drag them to safety. Character A has an available carrying capacity of 10. Character B has a base carry value of 5 adjusted to 15 because of how much stuff they’re carrying. 

Character A could increase their capacity by dropping some things, character A could decrease the carry value of Character B by removing some things they’re carrying, or both. Dragging may also cause the carry value to be reduced because character A isn’t actually lifting character B completely off the ground. 

Guidelines:

1. Determining encumbrance should favor simplicity over realism.
2. The power to weight ratio of the character should be considered; an ant can carry a leaf many times heavier and larger than it, but that's pretty much all it’ll be doing until it puts the leaf down.
3. Players (and their characters) should be afforded the opportunity to decide what to take and leave or to "hire movers" or devise some other means by which to transport and store found items (buried treasure does exist).
4. Difficulty can be derived from multiple qualities, the same is true for carrying values.
5. The encumbrance value should affect the character's ability to interact with the setting; could be changes to difficulty ("I'm carrying 3 people, he only has himself"), or maybe in a turn-based action scenario it takes more rounds for a character to perform certain actions, or some combination.

## Sufficiently advanced technology and magic

**Extends:** Skills and tools

One of Arthur C. Clarke's three laws is: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Settings will tend to have degrees of technology or abilities. For example, it is more common to see 5 or 10 year old cars on the streets of the United States than newer or older cars. Therefore, technology and abilities may span from the mundane (everybody in this setting has ready access to such a thing) to the exceptionally rare (few characters have access).

Guidelines:

1. Setting and characters should inform their response; a seemingly mundane ring is found by a mundane human on Earth in the 1920s. They put it on and immediately get transported to a far off planet where everyone is wearing the same ring (mundane). They are making objects appear using the ring and their minds (mundane). To the earthling, however, this ring and ability are exceptionally rare (magic).
2. Gameplay consistency and balance should be considered, characters can become boring off too perfect and indestructible; maybe casting a spell always costs a predetermined amount from a battery or has similar cost associated with it or the disinti-ray-run can only be fired once every 3 rounds.

## Tool decay and destruction

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has five of the same items used on a rotating basis. This contributes to feeling things "aren't made like they used to.”

There’s a shirt purchased fifteen years ago, it's one of one hundred and only worn to weddings. Compare to a similar shirt worn every day and washed every night. Chances both shirts lasted for similar wear times but our perceptions often that first shirt lasted longer because we use date of purchase and disregard wear.

Guidelines:

1. Items should be given a useable life; represented by time, uses, a combination, or other means (see “Time and aging” extension).
2. The implementation should be easy to manage and administer; an item with a twenty year lifespan probably isn't worth tracking unless it becomes an heirloom (see “Offspring” extension).
3. This extension could be tied to the criticality extension whereby a type of critical failure renders the tool useless (see “Criticality” extension).
4. Decay should only be tallied on characters actively playing the game; a player with a gap in playing characters shouldn’t be concerned about the character not aging a day but losing their tools and skills because time waits for no player (see “Time and setting” extension).
5. The player(s) should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost; a maintenance tax.

## Becoming unskilled

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW does not inherently limit what skills characters can learn nor does it implement the concept of skill atrophy, which means characters can become (and stay) experts at every skill available; not normally how life works.

Guidelines:

1. Keep decay simple; maybe it's an artifact of being subdued, death and resurrection, reincarnation, some combination.
2. A rank should rarely return to 0, if ever; like riding a bike, it will tend to take less time to return to previous proficiency than it took to initially attain it.
3. Ranks should be balanced using a mundane to rare spectrum of difficulties; chances are most difficulties aren't a 10 or higher, making it harder to reach high-level ranks.
4. Succeding at a skill with a given difficulty should rejuvenate the protficiency points in the lower ranks.
5. Similar to the "Tool decay and destruction" extension, players could pay a tax to maintain skill proficiency; equivalent to joining a gym.

## Skill overlap

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Two skills may involve a third, but making the third a skill in and of itself may not be desirable; consider sneaking, hiding, and being unseen.

Being unseen while *not* moving, is hiding. Being unseen while moving, is sneaking. We decide that if a character sneaks, they're also hiding. A character hides with a difficulty 2 (level 1), earning 1 proficiency point toward hiding. That same character sneaks with a difficulty 2 (level 1), earning 1 proficiency point toward sneaking *and* hiding. (Similar to how skills and tools can increase in rank simultaneously - see the "Skills and tools" section.)

Guidelines:

1. Keep the number of overlapping skills to a minimum by having higher-level, generic skills; "stealth" instead of hiding and sneaking, for example.
2. If there are a lot of often used, potentially overlapping skills, consider implementing a battery for actions related to those skills; a stealth battery in a rogue-themed game, for example.

## Resistance

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Potential energy versus received  energy.

Difficulty describes how hard something is to hit not damage dealt. 

- The potential energy of an action tells us how much damage may be dealt. 
- The resistance level tells us how much of that potential energy can be absorbed before having a noticeable affect.

Examples:

Consider a super human theme. Character A fires a gun at character B who is super human. The difficulty is reduced to 1 (level 0); character A is going to hit character B. The potential energy of the bullet we decided would be 5; potential energy is never 0. Character B has a resistance to bullets set at 10. Character B's health battery is reduced by 0 (5 - 10).

Guidelines:

1. Resistance should be easy to calculate.
2. Resistance should use qualities of the defender that help it absorb energy; similar to how calculated difficulty should use qualities that help the defender evade.

## Scale

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Scale describes size, mass, and volume of objects (including living beings) compared to other objects. Generally speaking, the scale can determine how much impact an object can have on other objects.

Guidelines:

1. Scales will tend to be dynamic or static, favor the dynamic; dynamic is determined per interaction, while static is determined at creation.
2. Scale should affect impact.

Examples:

Consider a car accident using a dynamic scale. A motorcycle (scale 1) is hit by a truck (scale 5 times the scale of the motorcycle), which is hit by a semi-truck and trailor (scale 50 times the scale of the motorcycle); no one gets injured. 

The motorcyle takes 5 damage from the truck, twice; once when the truck first hit it and again when the semi-truck hit the truck pushing it into the motorcycle; the motorcycle is destroyed and the rider was able to jump to safety. The truck takes 1 damage when it hit the motorcycle, another 1 damage when it hit the mortorcycle the second time, and another 10 when the semi-truck hit it (it's one-tenth the scale of the semi-truck); the truck is destroyed and the driver had jumped out to check on the motorcyclist by the time the semi-truck hit the truck. The semi-truck takes 5 damage when it hits the truck (the truck is one-tenth the scale of the semi-truck); the semi-truck seems drivable and the driver seems uninjured. If the semi-truck had hit the motorcycle, the motorcycle would have taken 50 damage (the semi-truck is fifty times the scale).

Consider two semis using a dynamic scale. Both are 1. Both cause 1 damage to each other.

Consider two semis using a static scale. Both are 50. Both cause 50 damage to each other. (Scale might be used as part of resistance when using a static scale.)

## Subdue not kill

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Do characters go for killing or subduing their opponents?

Guidelines:

1. Allow for flexibility to widen role-play potential; sometimes a character may run into that one character they want to kill despite morality.
2. Establish a default and let players specify when they are going against the default to maintain flow.
3. Consider whether there is a cost to choosing one over the other; do characters develop something like post-traumatic-stress, for example?

## West Marches extension 

**Extends:** Player pacts *and* Setting

“West Marches” is a term describing a style of play that tends to facilitate player-driven storytelling, self-organizing teams, large player groups, and may solve pragmatic problems also addressed by player pacts. Fourth Earth RAW maintains the name and spirit of the style.

Instead of multi-session campaigns spanning months, if not years, real-time, emphasis is on an open environment in which individual players decide what to do when and alone or in groups. 

Guidelines:

1. Normally not a recurring game night with all players; instead, 1 or more players coordinate (with or without a narrator) to determine what they want to do and when they would like to attempt it. 
2. The player pool could be any number and should remain small enough during a session to make satisfying progress toward the goal; this combination allows for multiple parties, more elaborate sessions, while maintaining flow.
3. Player(s) decide what to do during the session, which may or may not be tied to any overarching plot: “There are these ruins outside this cave, the four of us would like to explore them” or “My character would like to build a house.”
4. Scheduling time should be coordinated with all involved; if there’s a narrator, they should be informed of expectations to determine preparation time.
5. What occurs at each session should be shared amongst the rest of the player pool; the story of the message deliver should be appropriate to the setting (a physical letter mailed) but the real-life mechanism doesn’t (an email), in both cases the character should be in a position to communicate. An unconscious character can’t write a letter asking friends for help and cellphone coverage in an underwater trench might be a bit sketchy.
6. The setting is shared amongst all players; knowledge of regions could be limited to only those characters with direct knowledge or based on messages and mapping from other players.
7. If a given desire requires more than 1 session, players should be made aware and to communicate their level of commitment or abandon the desire.

Even looser guidelines:

1. Each session starts and ends in the same location; how this is accomplished and communicated should be setting, theme, and character appropriate.
2. Time should be passing similarly for each character who is either relaxing or actively and passively pursuing their own desires (see “Time and aging” extension).
3. Should Limit how often certain characters and players can be in the same session to avoid turning the pool into multiple small parties or cliques; or, allow certain players to avoid ever being part of certain groups (maybe they’re upset with each other at moment).
4. Consider multiple narrators or guidelines on what sessions can be run just by players (technically all of them).
