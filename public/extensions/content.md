# Fourth Earth RAW: Extensions

The following extensions describe considerations to Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written). Extensions can be incorporated into gameplay one at a time, wholesale, or even just as a one off to get out of a sticky situation; they are modules that can be plugged in and unplugged from as you see fit. 

In the spirit of Fourth Earth RAW, these extensions don't describe a specific implementation; instead, it's the rationale driving the extension and guidelines in how one might implement it in a way that feels in keeping with Fourth Earth RAW.

## Offspring

**Extend:** Populating the setting

Characters can have children. The rules of which can be as simple or complex as the setting and theme allows. Can some species in the game reproduce asexually? or, does it require sexual reproduction? If it's sexual reproduction is it binary or something else? What if there is the equivalent of a sperm and egg but requires a intermediary to join the two (plants and bees, for a loose example)? What are the rituals involved (the male in a praying mantis pair is often killed)?

Some things to consider to get started:

1. When does the new character become playable? (Maybe it's age, maybe it's some form of money to simulate caring for a child long enough for them to become a character in the setting.)
2. Are there legal ramifications in the setting?
3. Are there biological constraints stopping reproduction? 
4. How does inhertance work? (Physical goods, traits, skills, and so on.)

## Criticality

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a success is more than a success. Sometimes a failure is more than a failure. While you can always narrate such things, sometimes players feel better if the dice make it happen.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Did they just not get a grip on it at all? Or, did it fall from their hands to the ground exploding the contents all over them? Or did they succeed wonderfully by grabbing the glass, dropping it, then catching mid-fall without spilling a drop?

The recommendation is to add a die of any type to the pool; it should be easy to differentiate between it and the rest of the pool (the criticality die). If the criticality die lands on a 1, the success or failure was critical in nature. The type of die could be different for each roll based on the context, the same for all situations, or something else entirely, whatever makes sense for the players and narrator.

The result of which could be pure narrative, maybe narrated by the player themselves. It could be based on another die roll against a list of options. It could be something else entirely. As with most of Fourth Earth RAW, it should be appropriate to the setting, theme, and context.

Criticality does not change the success or failure, just the severity and side-effects.

## Complications and partials

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a failure isn't a total failure (and it's not a critical failure); same with success. This is where complications and partials come in.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Well, they grabbed the glass but didn't realize the bottom had cracked, it stayed on the table. As they dragged it up to their lips juice splattered all over the countertop, the floor, their shoes, and the bottoms of their pant legs.

The recommendation for determining is the same as for using criticality, add a die to the pool; with a change. To allow this extension to be used with criticality, the same die would be rolled, only rolling the highest value on the die would result in a complication or partial. The character succeeds, with a complication (sprained ankle while climbing a tree); or, fails, with partially accomplishing their goal (still on the ground, but found an easier route). This also allows complications and partials to be used *without* criticality.

Complications and partials do not change the success or failure, just the means and amount by which the failure or success occurs.

## Multi-faceted actions

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes it might make narrative sense for an action to pull from more than just its target battery.

Consider a character with a fear of spiders who is going to kill a spider as a mundane (non-combat) action. The challenge level of killing the spider is set to 1 physical; however, for this character, an additional challenge level is presented targeting their mental battery and it's at a 5. The total challenge level is 6 and would require spending more from their mental pool to reduce the difficulty to 0.

## Initiative

**Extends:** Movement

Initiative is a mechanism used in roleplaying games to help facilitate action across multiple participants.

There are many methods of doing this. At one end is real time decision making; on the other is turn-based planning and tactics. An analogy of the former might be live-action roleplaying; the latter might be chess. In the former, action is happening all at once and there is little time to talk, players are the "boots on the ground" warriors. In the latter, action is paused until consensus on a plan is reach, players are strategists or puppeteers.

The questions to answer are:

1. How are actions planned and executed?
2. When do individual players execute or roll for their characters?
3. How are the rolls resolved?

For actions and planning they could be made individually or as a group; they could be private or public. Players could roll all at once or one at a time in rotation. Resolution of the rolls could be as one large group or on a per-turn basis.

Each method can solve different problems perceived by the group. 

Battles taking too long? Plan individually in private, optionally write the plan down, have everyone (opponents included) roll at the same time, players and narrator do the math, and then the narrator narrates what the math said happened.

Frustrated that characters can't change their action because they're committed? Take turns individually from action to resolution. Choosing the next person could be done by players calling on who's next, the roll of one or more dice, drawing a card from a deck, you name it. The point is to take each character in-turn from action to resolution randomly. (Would this change every round or stay the same for a session?)

Frustrated that a system uses stats and it causes the order to always be the same? See previous to change to random selection.

Ultimately, the method should be known, consistently applied, and not set in stone. If players get frustrated every time they are in a situation where there's initiative, they will tend to avoid situations where there's initiative.

Some terms:

1. Round: A unit of time in which all active participants perform an action.
2. Turn: A unit of time in which one participant performs their action.
3. Minor action: A unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed (pull pin from grenade).
4. Main action: A unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed (throw grendade).
5. Post-minor action: A unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed (yell "Duck" and do so).

## Sufficiently advanced technology and magic

**Extends:** Skills and tools

One of Arthur C. Clarke's 3 laws is: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

The setting will tend to have degrees of technology and abilities. The scale upon which these are placed will tend to be mundane on one end, advanced in the middle, and exceptionally advanced at the other end. The setting and theme direct what falls where and the exerience of a character will tend to direct their response.

A human earthling from 1950 is given a ring. A ring is mundane and this one doesn't seem particularly odd and the human puts the ring on. Upon placing the ring on their finger they are whisked away to another planet. Opening their eyes they see other humanoid beings distinct from one another. Some are flying. Others are manifesting all manner of objects with their minds. Here, the ring the character is wearing is also mundane; however, for the human, the ring is now magical. Here, everything these people are doing is mundane. Back on Earth and to this character, this is magic. (Magic is that which has not yet been explained.)

General rule is that if it's something everyone has access to and appears everywhere, it's mundane. With that said, if it tips the balance of the experience too far, the game becomes boring (or at least using the tool or magic does); the hero needs to lose their powers or tools to generate tension again. Therefore, to reclaim some of the balance, maybe the use of the power or tool comes at a higher cost; to cast a spell drains a battery, either a flat cost or is the target battery of the challenge level.

## Tool decay and destruction

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has 5 of that same item used on a rotating basis.

Consider a mundane item: a shirt. If I have one shirt and I wear it every day and wash it every night, it will not appear to last as long as if I had 100 shirts and only wore and washed the initial shirt every 100 days. With that said, the shirt itself has a lifespan based on wear time, usage, and maintainance. This is why I might be able to say I have a shirt that has lasted 15 years; it's not so much that the shirt has lasted 15 years, it's that I purchased it 15 years ago and it's not my only shirt and I only wear it to weddings.

One way to simulate the feelings of this concept would be through a slightly hyperbolic scarcity economy. It's hard to earn whatever the equivalent of money is for the setting and theme and tools cost a lot of that money. However, this might be difficult to fit into the setting and theme. Similarly, there could be a "tax" applied on a recurring basis for maintenance.

Another way would require a bit more administration on the part of the player, which is to simulate an idea akin to average useful life. The roof of a house, for example, is up to 20 years. For items with a lifespan that long it may not be worth tracking. This also tends to depend on how well maintained it is. Regardless, tools could be given something like a life battery representing estimated number of uses. Each use, it's reduced by one. When it hits 0, the tool needs to be replaced. (The way some games simulate this is to have a large number and variation of ever increasing strength tools characters need to buy in order to continue progressing in the game; by its nature Fourth Earth RAW does not operate this way.)

There could be a combination of the two. Each use drains the battery of the tool, paying the maintenance tax increases it by one.

Lastly, it could be used in conjunction with the criticality extension, where there is some probability that causes the tool to be rendered useless.

Or, again, some combination or something else entirely.

Given how attached players may get to tools, especially if they are rare, it is important that the mechanic for this be consistently applied, known to players, and makes sense given the setting, theme, and context (a character puts a knife in a drawer and goes on vacation, when they return it's disintegrated; there should be a good reason for that).

Basic guidelines (same applies to the "Becoming unskilled" section):

1. Decay is only tallied on characters actively playing the game; you shouldn't worry about opening a character who hasn't aged a day but whose tools are useless and somehow forgot how to do all they did before.
2. The player should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost, which should be recurring and automated by the player or narrator, the schedule for which is agreed to by both; a tax.

## Becoming unskilled

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW does not inherently limit what skills characters can learn. Without a mechanic like skill atrophy, that would mean a character could become a master at literally every skill available. This is not normally the way life works.

Generally speaking, unused skills are reduced in proficiency; don't do a cartwheel for 15 years, then attempt one. However, skills typically are not forgotten outright without some form of brain injury; "it's like riding a bike."

We don't have a lot of recommendations or examples of how this could be accomplished in a lightweight fashion that's not tied to an event; death. Here are some guiding principles though:

1. Over a period of time, proficiency points are taken from the higher ranks.
2. Succeeding at a skill at a given challenge level should rejuvinate all the points in the lower ranks.
3. A rank should never return to 0.
4. Characters could be offered a "tax" similar to what was described in the "Tool decay and destruction" section.

Again, consistently applied, known to players...

## Skill overlap

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Two skills involve a third skill. The third skill isn't necessarily a skill by itself: hiding and sneaking, for example.

Hiding is the ability to remain unseen while not moving. Sneaking is the ability to reamin unseen while moving. To make the skill list easier to manage, we might place both under the generic skill of "stealth." But maybe your setting and theme targets thieves and rogues. So, the subtle variation and separate proficiency in both is important; to the point that maybe there's a "stealth" battery. Or maybe some other rationale that makes sense to the players and narrator to keep them separate.

Why not have both?

A character hides at a challenge level 1 and earns one point torward their rank in hiding. Now, that same character sneaks at a challenge level 1 and earns one point toward their rank in sneak *and* another point in hide. (Similar to ranks increasing for a skill and tool separately but at the same time.)

The unique part of sneaking is the movement, hence no point earned in sneaking for only hiding. Both require hiding (going unseen), however, so sneaking does improve hiding. One could even argue that characters should get two points in hiding because sneaking is more difficult; not our argument to have.

## Resistance

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Character A hits character B (a zombie) with a homerun baseball swing; killing the zombie. Character A hits character C (also a zombie) in the same manner; unfortunately, character C is wearing a motorcycle helmet. Without resistance of some type in play, it might feel odd to the player that the zombie doesn't die; or, it might be odd that the zombie does.

Challenge level is mainly derived from qualities of the defender and alters the ability of the attacker to hit the defender. Potential energy is mainly derived from qualities of the attacker. Resistance is mainly derived from qualities of the defender to resist some of that potential energy.

Consider a super human theme with a relatively invincible character. They get shot by a gun. Maybe they have a resistance attribute: impervious to bullets. Consider the same theme and there's a character who can be flesh or metal; when they're flesh they have a different modifier than when they're metal. Further, maybe transforming from flesh to metal has a higher challenge level when in combat than when not.

The methods and rationale for calculating resistance should be consistently applied as well as being appropriate to the setting, theme, and context.

## Scale

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Scale describes size and mass and would change the challenge level as defender and amount of potential energy as attacker. If used in conjunction with the resistance extension, scale may also inform the resistance calculation; the chance of a human injuring a humpback whale by punching it is pretty slim.

There are two primary ways to calculate scale: static and relative.

In a static system a scale is made and living beings are placed somewhere on that scale. In a relative system the smallest participant in an interaction is 1 and everyone else is a relative size compared to that. The former tends to make things faster to calculate (because it's known up front) while the latter tends to allow for more flexibility in the setting (possibly adds a layer of nuance to combat as well).

Imagine a static scale of 1 to 10. We have 3 living beings: a krill, a human, and a humpback whale. The krill would be 1 and the whale would be 10, the human would be somewhere in between. We would then need some way to modify the challenge level and the potential energy based on that scale. Krill could easily hit a whale but probably wouldn't injure it in anyway. A whale isn't strategically targeting krill, it's more chance, but a whale can kill many krill in one move. The same would be true of a human versus krill because krill are just that small.

Now imagine a relative scale starting at 1. The whale is attacking the krill. The krill is 1 and the whale is 10,000 (if not more) times the size and mass; the challenge level for the whale to hit a specific krill is almost infinite. Now, the human is attacking the whale. The human is 1 and the whale is 100 (if not more); the challenge level for the human to hit the whale is almost 0 (if there was no water).

## Subdue not kill

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Do you prefer superheroes who kill their opponents or just subdue them? How about scientists?

With this extension the narrator and players decide on a default and what that looks like.

Maybe every encounter that turns to violence starts with establishing whether the character's intention is to subdue or kill. Maybe it's the game in general: Unless I say otherwise, I'm looking to subdue. Maybe it's a narrative device that can be switched during the interaction; like setting a weapon to stun, then kill, and back again, only the character is the weapon going through emotions of not know whether they want to kill this defender or not. Maybe when the character subdues the defender they must make the intentional choice to apply a secondary killing strike with no penalty to their turn or movement.

Maybe there is some form of in-game cost inherent in making the choice to kill versus subdue or vice versa.

What you do with subdued life forms is up to you but it should probably include them recovering at some point and should be consistently applied and in keeping with the setting, theme, and context.
