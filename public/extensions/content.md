# Fourth Earth RAW: Extensions

The following extensions add considerations to Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) commonly seen any many roleplaying games. Extensions can be incorporated into gameplay one at a time, wholesale, or even just as a one off to get out of a sticky situation; they are modules that can be plugged in and unplugged as you see fit. In the spirit of Fourth Earth RAW, these extensions don't describe a specific implementation; instead, it's the rationale driving the extension and guidelines in how one might implement it in a way that feels in keeping with Fourth Earth RAW.

## Criticality

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a success is more than a success. Sometimes a failure is more than a failure. While you can always narrate such things, sometimes players feel better if the dice make it happen.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Did they just not get a grip on it all? Or, did it fall from their hands to the ground exploding the contents all over them?

The recommendation is to add a die of any type to the pool; it should be easy to differentiate between it and the rest of the pool (the criticality die). If the criticality die lands on a 1, the success or failure was critical in nature. The type of die could be different for each roll based on the context, the same, whatever makes sense for the narrator and players.

The result of which could be pure narrative, maybe narrated by the player themselves. It could be based on another die roll against a table of options. It could be something else entirely. As with most of Fourth Earth RAW, it should be appropriate to the setting, theme, and context.

Criticality does not change the success or failure, just the severity and side-effects.

## Complications and partials

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a failure isn't a total failure (and it's not a critical failure); same with success. This is where complications and partials come in.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Well, they grabbed the glass but didn't realize the bottom had cracked, it stayed on the table. As they dragged it up to their lips juice splattered all over the countertop, the floor, their shoes, and the bottoms of their pant legs.

The recommendation is the same as for using criticality; with a change. To all this extension to be used with criticality, the same die would be rolled, only rolling the highest value on the die would result in a complication or partial. The character succeeds, with a complication; or, fails, with partially accomplishing their goal.

Complications and partials do not change the success or failure, just the means and amount by which the failure or success occurs.

## Resistance

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Character A hits character B (a zombie) with a homerun baseball swing; killing the zombie. Character A hits character C (also a zombie) in the same manner; unfortunately, character C is wearing a motorcycle helmet. Without resistance of some type in play, it might feel odd to the player that the zombie doesn't die; or, it might be odd that the zombie does.

Challenge level is mainly derived from qualities of the defender and alters the ability of the attacker to hit the defender. Potential energy is mainly derived from qualities of the attacker. Resistance is mainly derived from qualities of the defender.

Consider a super human theme with a relatively invincible character. They get shot by a gun. Maybe they have a resistance attribute: impervious to bullets. Consider the same theme and there's a character who can be flesh or metal; when they're flesh they have a different modifier number than when they're metal. Further, maybe that transformation can be instant but when in combat has a higher challenge level than when they're not.

The methods and rationale for calculating resistance should be consistently applied as well as setting, theme, and context appropriate.

## Subdue not kill

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Do you prefer superheroes who kill their opponents or just subdue them? How about scientists?

With this extension the narrator and players can decide on a default and what that looks like.

Maybe every encounter that turns to violence starts with establishing whether the character's intention is to subdue or kill. Maybe it's the game in general: Unless I say otherwise, I'm looking to subdue. Maybe it's a narrative device that can be switched during the interaction; like setting a weapon to stun, then kill, and back again, only the character is the weapon. Maybe when the character kills the defender they must make the intentional choice to apply a secondary killing strike with no penalty to their turn or movement.

What you do with subdued life forms is up to you but it should probably include them recovering at some point and should be consistently applied and in keeping with the setting, theme, and context.

## Tool decay and destruction

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has 5 of that same item used on a rotating basis.

Consider a mundane item: a shirt. If I have one shirt and I wear it every day and wash it every night, it will not appear to last as long as if I had 100 shirts and only wore and washed the initial shirt every 100 days. With that said, the shirt itself has a lifespan based on wear time, usage, and maintainance. This is why I might be able to say I have a shirt that has lasted 15 years; it's not so much that the shirt has lasted 15 years, it's that I purchased it 15 years ago and it's not my only shirt and I only wear it to weddings.

One way to simulate the feelings of this concept would be through a slightly hyperbolic scarcity economy. It's hard to earn whatever the equivalent of money is for the setting and theme and tools cost a lot of that money. However, this might be difficult to fit into the setting and theme. Similarly, there could a "tax" applied on a recurring basis for maintenance.

Another way would require a bit more administration on the part of the player, which is to simulate an idea akin to average useful life. The roof of a house, for example, is up to 20 years. For items with a lifespan that long it may not be worth even tracking that. This also tends to depend on how well maintained it is. Regardless, tools could be given something like a life battery representing estimated number of uses. Each use, it's reduced by one. When it hits 0, the tool needs to be replaced. (The way some games simulate this is to have a large number and variation of every increasing strength tools characters need to buy in order to continue progressing; by its nature Fourth Earth RAW does not operate this way.)

There could be a combination of the two. Each use drains the battery of the tool, paying the maintenance tax increases it by one.

Lastly, it could be used in conjunction with the criticality extension, where there is some probability that causes the tool to be rendered useless.

Or, again, some combination or something else entirely.

Given how attached players may get to tools, especially if they very unique, it is very important that the mechanic for this is consistently applied, known to players, and makes sense given the setting, theme, and context (a character puts a knife in a drawer and goes on vacation, when they return it's disintegrated; there should be a good reason for that).

## Becoming unskilled

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW does not inherently limit what skills characters can learn. Without a mechanic like this, that would mean a character could become a master at literally every skill available. This is not normally the way life works.

Generally speaking, unused skills are reduced in proficiency; don't do a cartwheel for 15 years, then attempt one. However, skills typically are not forgotten outright without some form of brain injury; "it's like riding a bike."

We don't have a lot of recommendations or examples of how this could be accomplished in a lightweight fashion. Here are the guiding principles though:

1. Over a period of time, proficiency points are taken from the higher ranks.
2. Succeeding at a skill at given challenge level should rejuvinate all the points for the lower ranks.
3. A rank should never return to 0.
4. Characters could be offered a "tax" similar to the tool decay and destruction extension.

Again, consistently applied, known to players...

## Initiative

**Extends:** Movement

Initiative is a mechanism used in roleplaying games to determine turn order in rounds of multiplayer action. Initiative is typically used as a way of managing combat. Fourth Earth RAW leans to realtime decision making rather than tactics and planning. The argument being that in combat, there isn't a lot of time to talk, coordinate, and all of the terrifying things are happening all at once. The following are brief descriptions of various way to facilitate combat as a narrator.

A brief bit of terminology:

1. Round: A unit of time in which all active participants perform an action.
2. Turn: A unit of time in which one participant performs their action.
3. Minor action: A unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed (pull pin from grenade).
4. Main action: A unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed (throw grendade).
5. Post-minor action: A unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed (yell "Duck" and do so).

This list is not exhaustive and is only presented to demonstrate solutions, problems, benefits, and drawbacks.

The first method involves individual planning, unknown to the other players. Players capture what they plan to do in secret. The plans are revealed and dice rolled; at the same time. The narrator does the same for the opponents. The results are scanned and the story of that round is then narrated. The following impactful outcomes result from this methodology and could be viewed as positive or negative by the players involved:

1. Simulates realtime and crazy (all-at-once) nature of combat.
2. Simulates the inability of participants to plan, because planning may be indispensible but plans are often become useless when met with reality.
3. Players are treated as individuals with individual goals, not a team with a unified goal.
4. Players can't alter their plans as the round progresses (all-at-once and crazy).

The second method involves lightweight group planning; sometimes a timer is started to keep from getting bogged down. Players say what their intent is out loud to the group. Once spoken the plan for the round is locked in place. and dice rolled; at the same time. Narrator does the same for the opponents. Results are scanned and the round narrated. The following impactful outcomes result:

1. Realtime nature of combat, with possible opportunity for characters to have insight into the intentions of their teammates, which does happen in teams.
2. Characters can work more as a team instead of individuals who happen to be in a shared space.

The third method involves possibly more group planning and uses a more traditional turn-based approach. Each player rolls a die, let's use [.1d20](one twenty-sided die); then players (and the narrator) perform their turns in order from highest-to-lowest or lowest-to-highest. Each participant then describes what they're going to do, then roll to see if they did what they set out to, makes any subsequent rolls, and then next person in line does the same. (A variation may involve rolling initiative with each round.) The following impactful outcomes result:

1. Order is random.
2. Turns executed in sequence allow characters to adjust their plans in the same round; the randomness plays into this adjustment.
3. Players may feel like they're working together more as plans are adjusted based on the outcome of the preceding turn.
4. Ties need to be considered and overcome, especially if there are a lot of participants.
5. Character turns may be interspersed with opponent turns.

The fourth method is similar to the second method, only characters stats or abilities are used. The impactrul outcomes are the same, with the addition of: The order of the players is typically the same every round and every combat unless the stats are changed.

The fifth method is a turn-based approach; however, the character who goes first may be based on a die roll or some other method determined by the narrator. Once the first character has performed their action, they choose who goes next. Most of the impactful outcomes from the third method apply here, with the addition of the following:

1. Characters can simulate combination attacks.
2. No ties possible.

The sixth method uses 2 dice and choosing one or the other based on known criteria; one die is for the characters and the other is for their opponents. Similar to the fifth method (with the possibility of ties) and: The entirety of the group gets to go; "Let me stand here until you're done beating on me."

There are subtle variations that can be added to any of these. For example, what if initiative was based on the type of weapon; all ranged weapons first followed by melee weapons. Or maybe the dice for the weapon being used. Or the scale of the character. It really just depends on what issues you are seeing and want to overcome.
