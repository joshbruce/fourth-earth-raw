# Fourth Earth RAW: Extensions
 
The following extensions describe considerations to Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) that, when incorporated, may offer heightened immersion or a way to overcome an otherwise unforseen obstacle. Extensions may be plugged into and unplugged from gameplay as you see fit. This plugging in may be done from the beginning or just in time, when needed; one at a time or wholesale. These extensions don't describe a specific implementation; instead, a basic purpose is given with various guidelines on implementation in keeping with Fourth Earth RAW.

Guidelines:

1. The implementations for each extension used should be known and agreed to by all parties involved; even if the implementation is, "We'll figure it out when we get there."
2. Implementations should be consistently applied (or renegotiated) once in place.

## Offspring

**Extends:** Populating the setting

Characters can have children. 

The rules of which can be as simple or complex as the setting and theme allows. 

Can some species in the game reproduce asexually? or, does it require sexual reproduction? If it's sexual reproduction is it binary or something else? What if there is the equivalent of a sperm and egg but requires an intermediary to join the two (plants and bees, for a loose example)? What are the rituals involved (the male in a praying mantis pair is often killed)?

Guidelines:

1. When does the new character become playable? (Maybe it's age, maybe it's some form of money to simulate caring for a child long enough for them to become a character in the setting.)
2. Are there legal ramifications in the setting?
3. Are there biological constraints stopping reproduction? 
4. How does inheritance work? (Physical goods, traits, skills, and so on.)

## Aging and calendars

**Extends:** Populating the setting *and* Movement

What's the oldest a character may live? Are there ailments that could shorten this lifespan (beyond fighting in battler)? How does the passing of assets work? Do the people in this setting celebrate events like birthdays? What about holidays? What is the timespan of events in your game?

In solo adventure or tabletop play, this extension could add a degree of administrative overhead. Players much be made aware of how much time is passing in the game. Maybe each session is quarter in game-time and each year is four seasons, which means every four sessions players age one year.

In computer-aided play it can be made a bit easier to track.

You may consider using this extension in conunction with the "Becoming unskilled" extension something similar to simulate the negative (or positive) effects of aging. 

## Only players roll

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Fourth Earth RAW uses the intent of an actor to determine who modifies difficulty or rolls a dice pool. Sometimes the actor may not have an associated player ([.NPCs](non-player characters)). Further, sometimes there is not another player to handle such reduction decisions and rolls. Finally, even if there is someone (a narrator) able to make those decisions and roll the dice, players may feel the narrator is "out to get them."

There are many ways for this to be accomplished:

1. Have a player take on the mantle of the NPC; this could end with characters taking it easy on their characters, which a narrator might also do.
2. Instead of having the NPC roll to hit, have the players roll to defend; maybe a failure or success against their own calculated difficulty level with the default being that NPCs will always try and cut the difficulty level in half.

There may be other ways to have be that only players reduce difficulties and roll dice, the guidelines here are:

1. It should be possible to succeed.
2. The implementation should reduce the opportunity or desire for players to invert the balance of the game; if the game is extremely hard, it should stay that way - if it's very easy and lighthearted, it should stay that way.

## Criticality

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a success is more than a success and a failure is more than a failure. Such things can be narrated and it may be helpful to have the dice remind players and narrators.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Did they just not get a grip? or, did the glass fall from their hands exploding the contents all over them and their surroundings?

Maybe they succeeded wonderfully by grabbing the glass without making a sound; taking a drink in one, fluid motion; and setting the glass back down without making a sound.

Guidelines:

1. Have two pools of at least 1 die each, which can be rolled simultaneously; the action pool and the criticality pool.
2. The two pools should be distinguishable from one another.
3. The result of the action pools determines success or failure while the result of the criticality pool determines, well, whether that success or failure was critical in nature.

Other considerations:

1. The criticality pool could be different or the same for each roll. Different could similate changing circumstances impacting probability of critical success; maybe [.1d10](one ten-sided die) or [.1d20](one twenty-sided die) based on how rested the character is.
2. There may be a follow on roll required determining the outcome of criticality; or, maybe whatever is narratively convenient.
3. The description of the criticality could be described by the player or the narrator.

Criticality does not change the success or failure, just severity and side-effects.

## Complications and partials

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a failure isn't a total failure (and it's not a critical failure); same with success. This is where complications and partials come in.

A character successfully climbs a tree with the complication of twisting their ankle on the way up. A character fails to climb a tree but realizes there's an easier path.

Guidelines:

1. Consider using the same pool as you would (or do) for criticality, only it's a different target.
2. Complications and partials should be usable with or *without* the criticality extension.

Complications and partials do not change the success or failure, just the means and amount by which the failure or success occurs.

## Multi-faceted actions

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes it might make narrative sense for an action to pull from more than 1 battery.

Consider a character with a fear of spiders who is going to kill a spider as a mundane (non-combat) action. Killing a spider is normally a physical difficulty 2 (level 1). However, this character has an additional mental layer, which changes it to difficulty 10 (level 5) requiring the player to spend 1 physical and 4 mental to reduce it to a difficulty 1 (level 0).

Guidelines:

1. The target battery for the action could be generic to the action (all players experience this), while the second battery is specific to the character.

## Re-roll

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes the dice don't cooperate and players would like a way to modify their roll.

One method would be to re-roll an entire pool (even if only one). Another method would be to allow re-rolling one particular die within a pool; criticality or complications, for example.

Guidelines:

1. The ability to re-roll should come at a cost to the player.
2. The cost of re-rolling an entire pool should feel less expensive than re-rolling a single die; a second roll of a pool has the same probability of success while rolling a specific die has a higher probability of turning a negiative to a positive, or vice versa.

## Initiative

**Extends:** Movement

Initiative is a mechanism used in roleplaying games to help facilitate action across multiple characters (and players).

Many methods exist. A spectrum might exist where one end represents real-time, individual decision making and the other end is turn-based, group decision making and planning; live-action compared to chess, respectively.

The questions to answer are:

1. How are actions planned and executed?
2. When do individual players execute or roll for their characters?
3. How are the rolls resolved?

Some terms:

1. Round: A unit of time in which all active participants perform an action.
2. Turn: A unit of time in which one participant performs their action.
3. Minor action: A unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed (pull pin from grenade).
4. Main action: A unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed (throw grendade).
5. Post-minor action: A unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed (yell "Duck" and do so).

Note: Minor and post-minor actions may be incorporated into the main action.

General guidelines:

1. Let the current state of players, the game, and the narrative inform which way to go.

Guidelines for real-time, individual:

1. Players might decide what to do individually, and write those decisions down.
2. All dice pools might be rolled at the same time.
3. The narrative is compiled based on the rolls.

Gudelines for turn-based, group:

1. There should be a time limit (or other loose "penalty" for planning that takes a long time).
2. There should be a mechanism for determing the order of execution and narration.

Battles taking too long? Plan individually in private, optionally write the plan down, have everyone (opponents included) roll at the same time, players and narrator do the math, and the player and narrator narrate what the math said happened.

The order never changes because it's based on static character traits, try something different.

Frustrated that characters can't capitalize on the actions of their peers? Switch from being more real-time to being more turn-based. (Maybe even tag team where the player who just went calls on the next player or character to go; friend or foe.)

## Encumbrance

**Extends:** Movement

How much can you carry?

When it comes to items they will most likely have a weight and scale compared to the strength of the character. Something light as a feather and 5 times the size of the character probably has a higher encumbrance value than light as a feather and 5 times *less* the size of the character.

Guidelines:

1. Determining encumbrance should favor simplicity over realism; maybe each character is given a carrying value and each item (or collection of items) causes that carrying value to be reduced, when it hits 0, they can't pick anything new up without heavy penalty.
2. The power to weight ratio of the character should be considered; an ant can carry a leaf many times heavier and larger than it, but that's pretty much all they'll be doing until they put the leaf down.
3. Players (and their characters) should be afforded the opportunity to decide what to take and to leave or to "hire movers" or devise some other means by which to transport and store items (buried treasure does exist).
4. Difficulty can be derived from multiple qualities, the same is true for carrying values.
5. The encumbrance value should affect the character's ability to interact with the setting; could be changes to difficulty ("I'm carrying 3 people, he only has himself"), or maybe in a turn-based action scenario it takes more rounds for a character to perform certain actions, or some combination.

## Sufficiently advanced technology and magic

**Extends:** Skills and tools

One of Arthur C. Clarke's three laws is: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Settings will tend to have degrees of technology or abilities. For example, it is more common to see 5 or 10 year old cars on the streets of the United States than newer or older cars. Therefore, technology and abilities may span from the mundane (everybody in this setting has ready access to such a thing) to the exceptionally rare (few characters have access).

Guidelines:

1. Setting and characters should direct their response; a seemingly mundane ring is found by a mundane human on Earth in the 1920s. They put it on and immediately get transported to a far off planet where everyone is wearing the same ring (mundane) and making objects appear using the ring and their minds (mundane). To the earthling, this ring and ability became exceptionally rare (magic).
2. Balance of gameplay should be considered in this type of technology or ability; maybe casting a spell always costs a predetermined amount from a battery or has similar cost associated with it.

## Tool decay and destruction

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has five of that same item used on a rotating basis.

The character has 1 mundane shirt. They wear the shirt everyday and wash it every night. This one shirt will not appear to last as long as if the character one hundred shirts and only wore and washed the initial shirt once every one hundred days. This is why some of us might feel things "aren't made like they used to"; we have a shirt we purchased fifteen years ago, it's one of one hundred and we only wear it to weddings, the shirt hasn't actually lasted fifteen years.

Guidelines:

1. Items should be given a useable life; represented by time, uses, a combination, or additions.
2. The implementation should be easy to manage and administer; an item with a twenty year lifespan probably isn't worth tracking.
3. This could be tied to the criticality extension as well whereby one form of critical failure renders the tool useless.
4. Decay is only tallied on characters actively playing the game; a player shouldn't worry about opening a character who hasn't aged a day but whose tools are useless and somehow forgot how to do all they did before.
5. The player(s) should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost; a maintenance tax.

## Becoming unskilled

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW does not inherently limit what skills characters can learn nor does it implement the concept of skill atrophy, which means characters can become experts at every skill available; not normally how life works.

Guidelines:

1. Keep it simple; maybe it's an artifact of being subdued, death and resurrection, reincarnation, some combination.
2. A rank should rarely return to 0, if ever; like riding a bike, it will tend to take less time to return to previous proficiency than it initially did.
3. Ranks can also be balanced by way of the mundane to rare spectrum of difficulties; most difficulties aren't a 20.
4. Succeding at a skill with a given difficulty should rejuvenate the protficiency points in the lower ranks.
5. Similar to the "Tool decay and destruction" extension, players could pay a tax to maintain skill proficiency; equivalent to joining a gym.

## Skill overlap

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Two skills may involve a third, but making the third a skill in and of itself may not be desirable; consider sneaking, hiding, and being unseen.

Being unseen while *not* moving, is hiding. Being unseen while moving, is sneaking. We decide that if a character sneaks, they're also hiding. A character hides with a difficulty 2, earning 1 proficiency point toward hiding. That same character sneaks with a difficulty 2, earning 1 proficiency point toward sneaking *and* hiding. (Similar to how skills and tools can increase in rank simultaneously - see the "Skills and tools" section.)

Guidelines:

1. Keep the number of overlapping skills to a minimum by having higher-level, generic skills; "stealth" instead of hiding and sneaking, for example.
2. If there are a lot of often used, potentially overlapping skills, consider implementing a battery for action those skills might use; a stealth battery in a rogue-themed game, for example.

## Resistance

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Potential energy versus delivered energy.

Character A hits character B (a zombie) with a home run baseball swing; killing the zombie. Character A hits character C (also a zombie) in the same manner; unfortunately, character C is wearing a motorcycle helmet. Without resistance of some type in play, it might feel odd to the player that the zombie doesn't die; or, it might feel odd that the zombie does.

- Difficulty describes how hard something is to hit. 
- The potential energy of an action tells us how much damage may be dealt. 
- The resistance level tells us how much of that potential energy can be absorbed before having a noticeable affect.

Consider a super human theme. Character A fires a gun as character B who is super human. The difficulty is reduced to 1; character A is going to hit character B. The potential energy of the bullet we decided would be 5; potential energy is never 0. Character B has a resistance to bullets set at 10. Character B's health battery is reduced by 0 (5 - 10).

Guidelines:

1. Resistance should be easy to calculate.

## Scale

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Scale describes size, mass, and volume of objects (including living beings) compared to other objects. Generally speaking, the scale can determine how much impact an object can have on other objects.

Guidelines:

1. Scales will tend to be dynamic or static, favor the dynamic; dynamic is determined per interaction, while static is determined at creation.
2. Scale should affect impact.

Consider a car accident using a dynamic scale. A motorcycle (scale 1) is hit by a truck (scale 5), which is hit by a semi-truck and trailor (scale 50); no one gets injured. The motorcyle takes 5 damage from the truck, twice; once when the truck first hit it and again when the semi-truck hit the truck pushing it into the motorcycle; the motorcycle is destroyed and the rider was able to jump to safety. The truck takes 1 damage when it hit the motorcycle, another 1 damage when it hit the mortorcycle the second time, and another 10 (it's one-tenth the scale of the semi-truck); the truck is destroyed and the driver started to jump out and out of the way after hitting the motorcycle. The semi-truck takes 5 damage when it hits the truck (the truck is one-tenth the scale of the semi-truck); the semi-truck seems drivable and the driver seems uninjured. If the semi-truck had hit the motorcycle, the motorcycle would have taken 50 damage (the semi-truck is fifty times the scale).

Consider two semis using a dynamic scale. Both are 1. Both cause 1 damage to each other.

Consider two semis using a static scale. Both are 50. Both cause 50 damage to each other. (Scale might be used as part of resistance when using a static scale.)

## Subdue not kill

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Do characters go for killing or subdueing their opponents?

Guidelines:

1. Allow for flexibility to widen roleplay potential; sometimes a character may run into that one character they want to kill despite morality.
2. Establish a default and let players specify when they are going against the default to maintain flow.
3. Consider whether there is a cost to choosing one over the other; do characters develop something like post-traumatic-stress, for example?
