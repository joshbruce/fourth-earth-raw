# Fourth Earth RAW: Extensions
 
The following extensions describe considerations to Fourth Earth [.RAW](Rules as Written) that, when incorporate, may offer heightened immersion or offer a way to overcome an otherwise unforseen obstacle. Extensions may be plugged into and unplugged from gameplay as you see fit. This plugging in may be done from the beginning or just in time, when needed; one at a time or wholesale.

In the spirit of Fourth Earth RAW, these extensions don't describe a specific implementation; instead, a basic purpose is given with various guidelines on implementation in keeping with Fourth Earth RAW.

## Offspring

**Extends:** Populating the setting

Characters can have children. 

The rules of which can be as simple or complex as the setting and theme allows. 

Can some species in the game reproduce asexually? or, does it require sexual reproduction? If it's sexual reproduction is it binary or something else? What if there is the equivalent of a sperm and egg but requires an intermediary to join the two (plants and bees, for a loose example)? What are the rituals involved (the male in a praying mantis pair is often killed)?

Guidelines:

1. When does the new character become playable? (Maybe it's age, maybe it's some form of money to simulate caring for a child long enough for them to become a character in the setting.)
2. Are there legal ramifications in the setting?
3. Are there biological constraints stopping reproduction? 
4. How does inhertance work? (Physical goods, traits, skills, and so on.)

## Criticality

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a success is more than a success. Sometimes a failure is more than a failure. While such things can be narrated, it sometimes feels more "fair" if the dice specify when it happens.

A character reaches for a glass; they fail. Did they just not get a grip? or, did the glass fall from their hands exploding the contents all over them and their surroundings?

Maybe they succeeded wonderfully by grabbing the glass without making a sound; taking a drink in one, fluid motion; and setting the glass back down without making a sound.

Guidelines:

1. Add one die to the pool; the criticality die.
2. The die should be dinstiguishable from the rest of the pool.
3. A result of a certain number on the die represents whether the success or failure was critical or not.

Other considerations:

1. The criticality die could be different for each roll representing the probability of criticality; maybe [.1d10](one ten-sided die) or [.1d20](one twenty-sided die) with a 10 or 5 percent chance of criticality, respectively.
2. The criticality die could be the same for each roll.
3. There may be a follow on roll required that determines what the critical nature looks like for both success or failure; or, may be whatever is narratively convenient.
4. The description of the criticality could be described by the player or the narrator.

Criticality does not change the success or failure, just severity and side-effects.

## Complications and partials

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes a failure isn't a total failure (and it's not a critical failure); same with success. This is where complications and partials come in.

A character successfully climbs a tree with the complication of twisting their ankle on the way up. A character fails to climb a tree but realizes there's an easier path.

Guidelines:

1. Consider using the same dies as you would for criticality, only it's a different target number.
2. Complications and partials should be usable with or *without* the criticality extension.

Complications and partials do not change the success or failure, just the means and amount by which the failure or success occurs.

## Multi-faceted actions

**Extends:** Interacting with the setting

Sometimes it might make narrative sense for an action to pull from more than just its target battery.

Consider a character with a fear of spiders who is going to kill a spider as a mundane (non-combat) action. Killing a spider is normally a difficulty 2 action (position 1), physical. However, this character has an addition mental layer, which increases the action to a difficulty 10, which will require spending 1 physical and 4 mental to get to a difficulty of "Done!"

Guidelines:

1. The primary battery for the action could be generic to the action (all players experience this), while the seconday battery is specific to the character.

## Initiative

**Extends:** Movement

Initiative is a mechanism used in roleplaying games to help facilitate action across multiple characters (and players).

Many methods exist. A spectrum might exist where one end represents real-time, individual decision making and the end is turn-based, group decision making and planning; live-action compared to chess, respectively.

The questions to answer are:

1. How are actions planned and executed?
2. When do individual players execute or roll for their characters?
3. How are the rolls resolved?

Some terms:

1. Round: A unit of time in which all active participants perform an action.
2. Turn: A unit of time in which one participant performs their action.
3. Minor action: A unit of time during a turn when a short action is performed (pull pin from grenade).
4. Main action: A unit of time during a turn when the action required to achieve the intent is performed (throw grendade).
5. Post-minor action: A unit of time during a turn when another minor action is performed (yell "Duck" and do so).

General guidelines:

1. Let the current state of players, the game, and the narrative inform which way to go.
2. The method(s) should be known and their use should be agreed upon by those involved.

Guidelines for real-time, individual:

1. Players might decide what to do individually, and write those decisions down.
2. All dice pools might be rolled at the same time.
3. The narrative is compiled based on the rolls.

Gudelines for turn-based, group:

1. There should be a time limit (or other loose "penalty" for planning that takes a long time).
2. There should be a mechanism for determing the order of execution and narration.

Battles taking too long? Plan individually in private, optionally write the plan down, have everyone (opponents included) roll at the same time, players and narrator do the math, and then the narrator narrates what the math said happened.

The order never changes because it's based on static character stats, try something different.

Frustrated that characters can't capitalize on the actions of their peers? Switch from being more real-time to being more turn-based. (Maybe even tag team where the character who just went calls on the next character to go; friend or foe.)

## Encumbrance

**Extends:** Movement

How much can you carry?

When it comes to items they will most likely have a weight and scale compared to the strength of the being trying to carry said item. Something light as a feather and 5 times the size of the character probably a higher encumbrance value than light as a feather and 5 times *less* than the size of the character.

Guidelines:

1. Determining encumbrance should favor simplicity over realism; maybe each character is given a carrying value and each item (or collection of items) causes that carrying value to be reduced, when it hits 0, they can't pick anything new up.
2. The power to weight ration of the being should be considered; an ant can carry a leaf many times heavier than it, but that's pretty much all they'll be doing until they put the leaf down.
3. Players (and their characters) should be afforded the opportunity to decide what to take and to leave or to "hire movers" or devise some other means by which to transport and store items (buried treasure does exist).
4. Difficulty can be derived from multiple qualities, the same is true for carrying values.
5. The encumrance value should affect the character's ability to interact with the outside world; could be changes to difficulty ("I'm carrying 3 people, he only has himself"), or maybe in a turn-based action scenario it takes more rounds for a character to perform certain actions, or some combination.

## Sufficiently advanced technology and magic

**Extends:** Skills and tools

One of Arthur C. Clarke's 3 laws is: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Settings will thend to have degrees of technology or abilities. For example, it is more common to see cars that are 5 or even 10 years old on the streets of the United States than any other year. Therefore, technology and abilities may span from the mundane (everybody in this setting has ready access to such a thing) to the exceptionally rare (few characters have access).

Guidelines:

1. Setting, theme, and characters should direct their response; a seemingly mundane ring is found by a mundane human on Earth, who wears it. They are transported to a far off planet where everyone is wearing the same ring (mundane) and making objects appear using the ring and their minds (mundane). To the earthling, this is rare (magic).
2. Balance of gameplay should be considered in this type of technology or ability; maybe casting a spell always costs a predetermined amount from a battery.

## Tool decay and destruction

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Generally speaking, an item used multiple hours per day every day will decay faster than if one has 5 of that same item used on a rotating basis.

The character has 1 mundane shirt. They wear the shirt everyday and wash it every night. This 1 shirt will not appear to last as longer as if the character 100 shirts and only wore and washed the initial shirt once every 100 days. This is why some of us might feel things "aren't made like they used to"; we have a shirt we purchased 15 years ago, it's one of 100 and we only wear it to weddings, the shirt hasn't actually lasted 15 years.

Guidelines:

1. Items should be given a useable life; represented by time, uses, a combination, or additions.
2. It should be easy to manage and administer; an item with a 20 year lifespan probably isn't worth tracking and maybe characters can pay a certain "tax" to maintain their heavy use items.
3. This could be tied to the criticality extension as well whereby one form of critical failure renders the tool useless.
4. Decay is only tallied on characters actively playing the game; a player shouldn't worry about opening a character who hasn't aged a day but whose tools are useless and somehow forgot how to do all they did before.
5. The player(s) should be given a method by which to intentionally maintain tools and practice skills at a cost.

## Becoming unskilled

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Fourth Earth RAW does not inherently limit what skills characters can learn nor does it implement the concept of skill atrophy, which means characters can become experts at every skill available; not normally how life works.

Guidelines:

1. Keep it simple; maybe it's an artifact of being subdued, death and resurrection, reincarnation, some combination.
2. A rank should rarely return to 0, if ever; like riding a bike, it will tend to take less time to return to previous proficiency than it initially did.
3. Ranks can also be balanced by way of the mundane to rare spectrum of difficulties; most difficulties aren't a 20.
4. Succeding at a skill with a given difficulty should rejuvenate the protficiency points in the lower ranks.
5. Similar to the "Tool decay and destruction" extension, players could pay a tax to maintain skill proficiency; equivalent to joining a gym or having one at "the base."

## Skill overlap

**Extends:** Skills and tools

Two skills may involve a third, but making the third a skill in and of itself may not be desirable; consider sneaking, hiding, and being unseen.

Being unseen while still, is hiding. Being unseen while moving, is sneaking. We decide that if a character sneaks, they're also hiding. A character hides with a difficulty 2, earning 1 proficiency point toward hiding. That same character sneaks with a difficulty 2, earning 1 proficiency point toward sneaking and hiding. (Similar to how skills and tools can increase in rank simultaneously - see the "Skills and tools" section.)

Guidelines:

1. Keep the number of overlapping skills to a minimum by having higher-level, generic skills; "stealth" instead of hiding and sneaking, for example.
2. If there a lot of skills that might overlap that are used often, consider implementing a battery for actions that would use those skills; a stealth battery in a rogue themed game, for example.

## Resistance

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Potential energy versus delivered energy.

Character A hits character B (a zombie) with a home run baseball swing; killing the zombie. Character A hits character C (also a zombie) in the same manner; unfortunately, character C is wearing a motorcycle helmet. Without resistance of some type in play, it might feel odd to the player that the zombie doesn't die; or, it might feel odd that the zombie does.

Difficulty describes how hard something is to hit. The potential energy of an action tells us how much damage may be dealt. The resistance level tells us how much of that potential energy can be absorbed before having a noticeable affect.

Consider a super human theme. Character A fires a gun as character B who is super human. The difficulty is reduced to "Done!"; character A is going to hit character B. The potential engery of the bullet we decided would be 5. Character B has a resistance to bullets set at 10. Character B's health battery is reduced by 0.

Guidelines:

1. Resistance should be easy to calculate.
2. The resistance calculation should be consistantly applied.

## Scale

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Scale describes size, mass, and volume of objects (including living beings) compared to other objects. Generally speaking the scale can determine how much impact an object can have on other objects.

Guidelines:

1. Scales should be consistently dynamic or static - favor the dynamic; dynamic is determined per encounter, static means objects are placed on the scale at creation.
2. Scale should affect impact.

Consider a car accident using a dynamic scale. A motorcycle (scale 1) is hit by a truck (scale 5), which is hit by a semi-truck and trailor (scale 50); no one gets injured. The motorcyle takes 5 damage when hit by the truck and an addition 5 when the trucks is pushed into the motorcycle again - destroyed; luckily the rider was able to jump off before getting hit either time. The truck takes 1 damage when it hit the motorcycle, another 1 when it hit the second time, and another 50 when the semi-truck hit it - destroyed; luckily when the driver hit the motorcycle they were already unbuckling and opening the door when the noticed the semi. The semi-truck takes 5 damage when it hits the truck - most likely still drivable; the driver is also fine.

Consider two semis using a dynamic scale. Both are 1. Both cause 1 damage to each other.

Consider two semis using a static scale. Both are 50. Both cause 50 damage to each other. (Scale might be used as part of resistance when using a static scale.)

## Subdue not kill

**Extends:** Interacting with other living beings

Do characters go for killing or subdueing their opponents?

Guidelines:

1. Allow for flexibility to widen roleplay potential; sometimes a character may run into that one character they want to kill despite morality.
2. Establish a default and let players specify when they are going against the default to maintain flow.
3. Consider whether there is a cost to choosing one over the other; do characters develop something like post-traumatic-stress, for example?

## Re-roll

Sometimes the dice don't cooperate and players would like a way to modify their roll.

One method would be to re-roll an entire pool (even if only one). Another method would be to allow re-rolling one particular die within a pool; criticality or complications, for example.

The main recommendation here is that it should come at a cost to the player.

Fourth Earth RAW has many ways to incorporate this cost; battery or proficiency points, for example. If you're using something equivalent to money, that could also be used. Or, you could come up with some other type of token specifically for such an endeavor that is rewarded on using a different mechanism than any of those.
