# Fourth Earth TT

Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop) presumes two, optional things:

1. multiple players and
2. a designated narrator.

If implementations and guidelines are not described here, see Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures). Fourth Earth TT also bridges the gap between pen-and-paper and digital-assisted play. 

## Characters

Guidelines:

1. Non-player characters are typically played by the narrator (see "Player pacts" section).

## Interacting with the setting

### Roll to evade

Guidelines:

1. Using roll to evade or having the narrator roll to attack for non-player characters should be agreed to by all players (see "Player Pacts" section).

## Player pacts

Guidelines:

1. Players (including the narrator) should discuss the role of the narrator; what will be most beneficial and enjoyable for all players, including the narrator?
2. Typical narrator responsibilities: 
3. ensure players keep their pacts and
3. ensure players play by the agreed to implementations (or assist making balanced modifications).
4. Players should decide and agree to what happens if a player is unable to attend a session, because life happens (see Fourth Earth RAW: Additions "West marches" section).

The typical responsibilities listed above can be performed by the players themselves; however, it can sometimes be difficult without a separate narrator.
