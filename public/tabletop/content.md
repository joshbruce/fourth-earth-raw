# Fourth Earth TT

Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop) presumes two, optional things:

1. there are multiple players and
2. there is a narrator.

If implementations and guidelines are not described here, see Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures). Fourth Earth TT also bridges the gap between pen-and-paper and digital-assisted play. 

## Characters

Guidelines:

1. Non-player characters are typically played by the narrator (see Fourth Earth TT "Player pacts" section).

## Interacting with the setting

### Roll to evade

Guidelines:

1. Using roll to evade or having the narrator roll to attack for non-player characters should be agreed to by all players (see Fourth Earth TT "Player Pacts" section).

## Player pacts

Guidelines:

1. Players (including the narrator) should discuss the role of the narrator; what will be most beneficial and enjoyable for all players, including the narrator?
2. One role the narrator typically plays is ensuring players keep to the agreed upon pacts.
3. Another typical role is similar to a referee, which is to blow a whistle and make sure players are playing by the agreed to implementations (or making balanced modifications).
4. Players should decide and agree to what happens if a player is unable to attend a session, because life happens (see Fourth Earth RAW additions "West marches" section).

The "typical" roles listed above can be performed by the players themselves; however, it can sometimes be difficult without a formal narrator.
