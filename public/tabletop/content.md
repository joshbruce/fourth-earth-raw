# Fourth Earth TT

Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop) is an expansion of Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.SA](solo adventures) intended for multiplayer gameplay in a tabletop or pen-and-paper fashion. Fourth Earth TT also acts as a bridge between face-to-face play and digital play by introducing web-based tools that can help automate some aspects and extensions. Fourth Earth TT presumes multiple players and a narrator; both of which are still optional.

Multiple players creates a layer of potential surprise (pleasant and otherwise) as those players will cause their characters to make choices you would not have made had you been playing them.

The narrator is a multifaceted role with arguably the primary goal being to facilitate and narrate the story as it unfolds. There are many resources on how to perform this role, which may be named: dungeon master, game master, director, storyteller, and similar.

Anything described here is possible in Fourth Earth SA and Fourth Earth CA as well.

Fourth Earth TT presumes a bit more equipment availability. For example, you might have tables, a space to meet (physical or virtual), miniatures, and so on.
