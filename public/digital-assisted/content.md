# Fourth Earth DA

Fourth Earth [.DA](digital assisted) presumes access to some form of digital assistant or computer; with or without internet access. If implementations are not found here, see Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop).

Digital assistance typically provides:

- automations of certain tasks introduced by addition implementations,
- replacement for traditionally physical tools (dice, for example), and
- automations for the referee role of a narrator.

Many of these tools are provided by the creators and maintainers of Fourth Earth RAW and Fourth Earth Tools (available at 4th.earth). Tools are provided per the terms of service and are offered free of charge or on a subscription basis, depending on the tool.

## Setting

Fourth Earth RAW is designed to be setting agnostic and usable within settings that are system agnostic (or that can be modified to be more system agnostic).

Fourth Earth Lore is designed to be system agnostic and describes the canonical Fourth Earth setting, which is licensed under the [Creative Commons, Attribution 4.0 licens](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). 

## Characters

Most tracking of character stats, skills, and tools can be digitized. 

Official Fourth Earth RAW character sheets are available for both RAW and SA specifications.

## Interacting with the setting

There are many digital tools available that simulate rolling dice (choosing random numbers) and similar options exist for automating calculations.

The official Fourth Earth Dice Tower, for rolling dice, is available at tower.4th.earth. Official Fourth Earth RAW calculators are available in portable formats.

### Complications and partials addition

Complications and partials tend to be more action- and narrative-specific. While the rolling of a criticality or complications die is a relatively simple thing digitally, proper game response isn’t always; therefore, this addition should be removed from most video game versions.

### Re-roll addition

Re-rolling mechanics are relatively simple to implement with enhanced tabletop. Video game implementations that don’t hinder flow may be difficult to come up with, especially when using real-time (not strict turn-based) interactions.

### Scale addition

If you’re looking to automate calculations involving scale, it might be beneficial to generate a static size that can be applied to all characters. Sizes will typically hold character types less than double the size of one another. 

Guidelines:

1. It’s easier to add larger things than smaller things to the static scale. 
2. Use groups and swarms to help scale up smaller characters (like a bee, for example).

 Consider:
 
 The smallest thing that can be a character in your setting becomes size 1; anything smaller and less than double the size is also a 1. 
 
 With a “floor” established, use multiples to assign a size to other character types in the setting (this can also be done as play continues).
 
 These sizes can then be used to automate scale calculations.
 
 A rat is size 1, a human is 10, and a whale is 100. When the human interacts with the whale it’s a 1 to 10 scale; the whale is 10 times the scale of the human.

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

We want as many people as possible to experience the joy available from this type of gameplay; therefore, only one person needs to be subscribed to 4th.earth to create a world and invite players to it. The others players only need 4th.earth accounts.

You invite them, they sign in, join your game, and you play. Every player is given access to their character sheet.

The world you create is stored with you and their characters are stored with them.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Offspring extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

## Interacting with the setting

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Difficulty

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, the designated narrator (the one who started the game) defines difficulty and assigns them to players (with associated target battery). The players can then do what they want to do to try and accomplish what they were trying to accomplish.

### Life batteries

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In both editions, life batteries are managed automatically. 

### Dice pools

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In both editions, the type and number of dice in the pool are managed, and rolled, automatically. (Technical note: We use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to similate rolling the dice.)

### Criticality extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, you can disable this extension.

### Complication and partials extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, you can disable this extension.

## Movement

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Initiative extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, you can disable this extension.

## Skills and tools

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, you can create as many skills as you like and easily add proficiency points.

In the MORPG edition, skills and tools are managed automically.

### Sufficiently advanced technology and magic extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, if your world doesn't have magic, disabling this extension is not necessary; you can use the spirit battery for something else or not at all.

In the MORPG edition, magic is automatically managed.

## Interacting with other living beings

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, a difficulty is defined and interacted with by the player.

In the MORPG edition, interactions are automatically resolved.

### Resistance extension
