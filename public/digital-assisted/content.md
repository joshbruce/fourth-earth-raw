# Fourth Earth DA

Fourth Earth [.DA](digital assisted) presumes access to some form of digital assistant or computer; with or without internet access. If implementations are not found here, see Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop).

Digital assistance typically provides:

- automations of certain tasks introduced by addition implementations,
- replace traditionally physical tools (dice, for example), and
- automate the referee role of a narrator.

Many of these tools are provided by the creators and maintainers of Fourth Earth RAW and the 4th.earth site. Tools are provided per the terms of service and are offered free of charge or on a subscription basis, depending on the tool.

**Terms:**

- Fourth Earth [.MUD](multi-user dungeon): A West Marches style text-based, online game using the Fourth Earth RAW system in the Fourth Earth Lore setting.

## Setting

Fourth Earth RAW is designed to be setting agnostic and usable within settings that are system agnostic.

Fourth Earth Lore describes the canonical Fourth Earth setting, which is licensed [under CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) designed to be system agnostic. 

## Characters

## Populating the setting

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

We want as many people as possible to experience the joy available from this type of gameplay; therefore, only one person needs to be subscribed to 4th.earth to create a world and invite players to it. The others players only need 4th.earth accounts.

You invite them, they sign in, join your game, and you play. Every player is given access to their character sheet.

The world you create is stored with you and their characters are stored with them.

### Healing, death, resurrection, and reincarnation

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

### Offspring extension

See Fourth Earth SA (and Fourth Earth Lore).

## Interacting with the setting

### Difficulty

See Fourth Earth RAW (and Fourth Earth Lore).

In the tabletop helpers edition, the designated narrator (the one who started the game) defines difficulty and assigns them to players (with associated target battery). The players can then do what they want to do to try and accomplish what they were trying to accomplish.
