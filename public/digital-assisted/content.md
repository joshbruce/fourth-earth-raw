# Fourth Earth DA

Fourth Earth [.DA](digital assisted) presumes access to some form of digital assistant or computer; with or without internet access. If implementations are not found here, see Fourth Earth [.RAW](rules as written) and Fourth Earth [.TT](tabletop).

Digital assistance typically provides:

- automations of certain implementations,
- replacement for physical tools (such as dice), and
- automations for some narrator responsibilities.

Many tools are provided by the creators and maintainers of Fourth Earth RAW and Fourth Earth Tools (available at 4th.earth). Tools are provided per the terms of service.

## Setting

Fourth Earth RAW is designed to be setting agnostic and usable with system agnostic settings.

Fourth Earth Lore is designed to be system agnostic and describes the canonical Fourth Earth setting, which is licensed under the [Creative Commons, Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). 

## Characters

Most tracking of character-related qualities can be automated or simplified. 

Official Fourth Earth RAW character sheets are available for both RAW and SA specifications.

## Interacting with the setting

There are many digital tools available for simulating dice (or choosing random numbers).

The official Fourth Earth Dice Tower, for rolling dice, is available at tower.4th.earth.

### Criticality addition 

Implementation:

1. See Fourth Earth SA, “Criticality addition” section.
2. Only applies to combat interactions; opposing characters may roll criticality as well.

### Complications and partials addition

Guidelines (video game):

1. Addition should be removed as complications and partials do not lend themselves as easily to the pre-scripted responses of a video.

### Re-roll addition

Guidelines (video game):

1. For real-time video games, this addition should be removed as there may be no pause between turns.

## Interacting with characters

### Scale addition

If you’re looking to automate calculations involving scale, it might be beneficial to generate a static size that can be applied to all characters. Sizes will typically hold character types less than double the size of one another. 

Guidelines:

1. Use a static scale at the time of creation them calculate and use a ratio at the time of encounter.
2. Use groups and swarms to help scale up smaller characters (like a bee, for example).

 Consider:
 
 The smallest thing that can be a character in your setting becomes size 1; anything smaller and less than double the size is also 1. 
 
 With a “floor” established, use multiples to assign a size to other character types in the setting (this can also be done as play continues).
 
 These sizes can then be used to automate scale calculations.
 
 A rat is size 1, a human is 10, and a whale is 100. When the human interacts with the whale it’s a 1 to 10 ratio; the whale is 10 times the scale of the human (just like the rat interacting with the human.

### Stance addition 

Guidelines (video game, real-time):

1. If a player wants to use one of their inputs into the game to change stance, they should’ve allowed to do so; however, they should not automatically change stances.

### Roll to evade addition

Guidelines (video game):

1. As character rolls can be automated, this addition should be removed; all characters roll, if necessary.

### Assist addition 

Guidelines (video games):

1. Characters may assist one another; however, it is when they are able to take an action.

## Ranks

Guidelines (video game):

1. Tracking of proficiency points, ranks, and the creation of dice pools should be automated, if possible.

## Time and space

Guidelines (video game):

1. Keep it simple; the ability to automate can leas to robust and ultimately complex implementations. 
2. Automate as much as possible.

### Initiative addition 

Guidelines (video game, real-time):

1. If the character can act, the side-effect of that action should be immediate; therefore, initiative to determine if an action is negated is handled innately.

## Player pacts

Guidelines (multiplayer video game):

1. Create a code of conduct describing hard boundaries for player and character behavior.
2. Avoid preemptive boundary setting beyond dealbreakers; otherwise, you are solving problems the community doesn’t have yet.
